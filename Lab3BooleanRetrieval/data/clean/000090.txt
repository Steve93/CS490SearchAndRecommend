in
the

the
book
also
follow
the
familiar
genr

—
think
of
it
as
a

the
detect
okay
he
’s
just
a
monk
too
but
a
veri
smart
one
william
of
baskervil
is
ask
by
the
abbot
to
get
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
baskervil
is
assist
by
adso
of
melk
who
is
sort
of
a
tonsur
dr.
watson
in
fact
i
kept
wait
for
william
to
interject
"
eleemosynari
my
dear
novic
adso
"
in
the
background
eco
construct
a
labyrinth
of
support
plot
includ
one
involv
a
labyrinth
william
ha
arriv
at
the
abbey
as
a
repres
of
emperor
loui
iv
in
order
to
particip
in
negoti
also
involv
emissari
from
the
pope
who
is
in
heat
conflict
with
the
emperor
and
the
franciscan
order
then
caught
in
the
crossfir
between
secular
and
ecclesiast
agenda
thi
part
of
the
stori
draw
the
reader
into
further
subplot
involv
heret
and
rebelli
church
movement
and
the
variou
inquisit
and
repress
action
employ
in
combat
them
and
all
these
element
draw
in
aspect
of
theolog
philosophi
and
histori
that
constantli
linger
in
the
background
of
the
name
of
the
rose
and
sometim
domin
the
foreground
as
well.thi
may
sound
dri
and
academ
but
eco
build
hi
polem
around
forc
person
like
ani
good
mysteri
writer
he
know
that
it
is
essenti
to
popul
hi
stori
with
mani
like
suspect
a
plethora
of
possibl
murder
here
we
encount
salvator
the
secret
and
glutton
monk
who
speak
in
a
strang
composit
jargon
—
made
up
of
bit
and
piec
of
contemporari
and
ancient
languag
—
and
who
is
disturbingli
vagu
when
ask
about
certain
particular
in
hi
past
malachi
the
librarian
also
arous
our
suspicion
he
never
allow
anyon
into
the
third
floor
of
the
aedificum
the
fortress
where
the
abbey
’s
rare
collect
of
manuscript
and
book
are
held

mysteri
light
can
be
seen
through
the
window
at
night
severinu
the
doctor
and
herbalist
might
also
be
a
murder
—
he
know
an
uncanni
amount
about
rare
poison
jorg
of
brugo
the
blind
man
seem
to
know
even
darker
secret
and
show
up
quietli
and
stealthili
at
the
least
expect
moment
even
abo
the
abbot
is
not
abov
reproach
and
come
across
as
far
more
concern
with
worldli
rich
and
power
than
is
befit
for
a
benedictin
monk
but
the
most
compel
charact
is
our
detect
william
of
baskervil
have
you
encount
mysteri
where
the
privat
investig
wa
onc
a
policeman
but
left
the
forc
after
encount
too
much
corrupt
well
the
same
is
true
of
william
except
the
organ
he
left
behind
wa
n't
the
l.a.p.d
but
the
inquisit
fill
in
your
own
wisecrack
here
he
did
n't
like
the
modu
operandi
and
now
oper
as
a
free
agent
but
—
unlik
your
typic
privat
eye
—
he
ha
the
benefit
of
an
oxford
educ
and
mentor
by
roger
bacon
and
william
of
ockham
whose
approach
to
natur
philosophi
prove
to
be
a
good
mediev
substitut
for
a
degre
in
criminolog
much
ha
chang
in
the
world
sinc
the
late
middl
age
but
there
are
some
constant
the
seven
deadli
sin
are
still
around
and
if
you
have
ani
doubt
over
how
deadli
they
might
be
the
name
of
the
rose
will
settl
the
argument
eco
also
add
a
convinc
love
stori
with
just
the
right
dose
of
concupisc
for
the
modern
reader
—
not
easi
for
a
stori
set
in
a
monasteri
but
our
author
is
a
master
of
plot
so
such
obstacl
are
deftli
overcom
all
in
all
the
name
of
the
rose
combin
the
best
element
of
a
histor
