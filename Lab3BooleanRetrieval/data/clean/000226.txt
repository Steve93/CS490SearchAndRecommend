–
see
all
my
review
i
saw
memento
veri
recent
someth
that
turn
out
to
be
a
great
miss.i
saw
it
again
just
to
make
a
coupl
of
thin
straight-and
i
'll
definit
do
the
same
with
inception.christoph
nolan
keep
improv
himself
with
even
more
complex
and
multilay
script
like
this.and
i
thought
memento
wa
hard
to
reach
by
most
of
the
viewer
but
no.incept
will
keep
you
mesmer
and
captiv
by
the
geniu
that
's
hidden
behind
it.and
not
just
director
and
screenwrit
or
with
other
words-nolan
but
with
act
and
sound-and
effect
and
edit
as
well.when
you
have
a
cast
like
this-i
mean
leonardo
dicaprio
joseph
gordon-lewitt
michael
cain
or
marion
cotillard
a
person
favorit
the
movi
just
keep
go
flawlessly.most
of
the
crew
is
the
same
the
nolan
brother
work
with
on
tdk
and
earlier
in
batman
begins.so
the
oscar
nom
in
those
categori
are
a
certainti
for
me.th
onli
thing
one
could
have
against
the
movi
is
the
headach
one
could
have.se
most
of
my
friend
go
to
the
movi
for
brainless
action
they
enjoy
iron
man
2
and
the
a-team
but
thi
movie-y
have
to
see
it
at
least
twice
to
understand
it.th
level
and
the
layer
on
which
thing
are
happen
are
so
mani
that
one
sure
'll
miss
someth
vital.thi
is
a
reason
for
not
fit
to
the
mass
audienc
but
i
hope
that
wo
n't
happen
becaus
nolan
is
one
of
my
favorit
directors/writ
and
he
show
that
the
brainless
action
flick
are
n't
all
of
it.ther
are
still
movi
like
incept
out
there
and
still
peopl
like
the
nolan
to
make
those
movi
so
it
's
not
all
lost.and
i
hope
thi
movi
could
show
the
audienc
that
the
stori
is
still
import
for
the
experi
one
could
receiv
not
the
endless
constant
explosions.becaus
thi
is
realli
a
one
of
a
lifetim
event.say
that
i
must
say
that
in
a
world
full
of
remak
reboot
sequel
prequel
and
god
know
what
thi
is
a
uniqu
chanc
to
see
someth
differ
and
unmatch
so
far-a
strong
movi
,
that
,
sure
will
be
nolan
's
latest
masterpiec
