a
note

if

mr.
howard
make
the
argument
in
hi
"
translat
's
note
"
that
the
languag
ha
chang
sinc
the
1940
's
and
that
a

is
need
i
could
n't
disagre
more
and
i
do
]
speak
with

experi
on

subject
:
i
read
thi
titl
at

in

origin
french
languag
for
three
differ
class
as
well
as
numer
time
in
english
the
wood
version
katherin
wood
beauti
captur
the
feel
of
the
french
origin
the
new
howard
translat
is
in
a
more
modern
english
which
mostli
succe
at
remov
the
poetri
that
previous
exist
and
littl
els
that
i
can
find
it
doe
not
make
the
stori
ani
more
clear
or
nuanc
than
it
previous
wa
rather
less
so
i
find
the
argument
for
a
new
translat
indefencible.thre
star
is
not
a
review
of
the
book
but
of
the
translat
thi
titl
is
beyond
excel
but
you
might
do
yourself
a
favor
