ringo
did
not

he

singl
in

earli
'70
often
benefit
from
the
assist
of
hi
former

yet
within
a
short
time
it
becam
appar
both
that
the
beatl
were
not
go
to
settl
their
differ
and
reunit
and
that
their
solo
work
could
not
compar
with
what
they
were
capabl

creat
togeth
the
stereotyp
ha
it
that
the

allow
each
of

to
indulg
in
their
worst
tendenc

mystic
mccartney
in

starr
in

there
's
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
thi
but
it
's
also
import
to
bear
in

that
what
wa
most
miss
wa
a
sens
of

interact
the
critic
parti
line
often
champion
lennon
as
the
angri
realist
rocker
and
mccartney
as
the
melod

but
thi
is
a
fallaci
each
of
them
wa
capabl
in
roughli
equal
measur
of
ballsi
all-out
rock
and
sweet
romantic
what
is
not
in
disput
is
that
they
spark
each
other
to
reach
height
that
they
could
not
attain
on
their
own
despit
period
rumor
of
reunion
throughout

no
group

came
close
to

it

that

hello

look
i
cant
say
i
heard
all
there
song
but
as
a
person
i
've
heard
alot
of
there
song
as
i
say
thi
i
fill
that
word
like
peopl
are
inspirationa
l
and
in
over
time
as
music
progress
artist
lose
there
train
of
thought
mean
there
heart
so
i
guess
what
im
say
is
sometim
you
have
to
crawl
befor
you
walk
which
thi
band
ha
did
and
more
band
like
them
fyi
im
