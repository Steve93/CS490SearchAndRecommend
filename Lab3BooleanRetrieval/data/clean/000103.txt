thi

in

of
the
best
way
i
can
imagin
a
friend
record
the
entir
book
on
tape
and
for
a
coupl
month
i
play
the
tape
of
her
read
a
chapter
or
two
just
befor
i
fell
asleep
each
night
my
slow
exposur
to
the
book
under
ideal
circumst
may
have
influenc
my
percept
but
i
can
say
on
each
subsequ
reread
of
the
book
i
've
come
to
appreci
it
more
you
can
read
the
book
just
for
the
stori
appar
the
author
wrote
the
book
from
stori
he
would
tell
hi
children
and
it
still
can
easili
serv
that
purpos
but
the
rich
of
hi
charact
lead
to
mani
interest
analog
to
human
life
for
instanc
from
hazel
you
can
learn
profound
thing
about
leadership
throughout
the
book
you
feel
that
hazel
is
the
natural-born
leader
of
hi
group
of
rabbit
but
richard
adam
wa
veri
care
to
develop
thi
impress
through
charact
featur
rather
than
power-rel
the
contrast
is
clearli
intent
sinc
the
other
leader
of
the
book
achiev
leadership
statu
through
veri
differ
mean
mani
peopl
think
the
book
take
a
strong
stanc
against
a
particular
kind
of
authoritarian
rule
but
it
is
import
to
recogn
the
book
give
thi
impress
not
through
structur
diatrib
or
through
argument
but
rather
it
evolv
out
of
charact
consider
and
out
of
the
stori
itself
thi
mean
that
the
result
is
far
more
complex
than
a
simpl
argument
for
instanc
although
gener
woundwort
may
be
seen
as
the
main
enemi
that
hazel
ha
to
deal
with
and
the
authoritarian
rabbit
is
portray
rather
neg
at
time
adam
quit
intent
add
some
detail
that
make
him
admir
to
the
other
rabbit
even
to
the
veri
end
a
diatrib
would
not
be
so
complex
fiver
is
anoth
great
charact
he
add
an
element
of
magic
to
the
stori
and
it
allow
adam
to
link
the
rabbit
he
describ
to
a
mythic
world
that
enter
into
the
stori
quit
frequent
one
can
almost
see
fiver
as
a
manifest
of
imagin
in
thi
world
big-wig
is
anoth
likabl
charact
and
the
stori
of
thi
rabbit
experi
in
efrafa
is
one
of
the
highlight
of
the
stori
besid
the
charact
the
descript
of
england
are
also
quit
acut
you
can
actual
track
the
cours
of
the
rabbit
on

sinc
adam
wa
care
to
describ
real
place
and
thing
that
attent
to
detail
is
often
miss
in
review
of
thi
book
final
the
thing
that
bring
all
these
featur
togeth
and
make
the
book
more
than
a
mere
stori
or
an
account
of
human
charact
or
a
diatrib
against
fascism
is
the
fact
that
adam
is
quit
consciou
of
the
fact
that
he
is
tell
the
stori
from
the
perspect
of
rabbit
the
challeng
they
face
are
rabbit-s
the
idea
about
the

the
philosoph

and

bring
mani
of
our
anthropomorph
idea
of
rabbit
togeth
with
the
realiti
of
rabbit
in

coher

i
suppos
the
book
can
be
seen
as
a
cultur

of
an
imagin
rich

i
realiz

doe
show

even
with

i
would

at

they
have
their

is

the
balanc
between

's
not

the

on

it
's
precis
the
open

that
made

unpalat
for

given
the

i
came
away
with
the

he
wa

anti-govern
he
seem
to

that
a

speak

that
even
though
these

take
on
some
human

i
never
realli
thought

as

i
wa
convinc
i
wa
read
a
book
about
rabbit
not
rabbit
with
human

that
to
me
is
a
major
achiev
and
at
the

in

earli
page
made
me
feel
like
i
wa
read
a
book
at
a
read
level
below
my
comfort
zone
rabbit
are
rel
simpl
anim
and
adam
adher
to
that
principl
for
most
of
the
book
clever
wa
a
rever
trait
among
warren
coloni
and
is
reflect
in
their
stori
of
past
accomplish
by
legendari

these
stori
pass
down
oral
from

provid
a
collect
sourc
of
cun
skill
that
are
appli
to
situat
beyond
the
natur
experi

our
erstwhil
hero
it
doe
n't
take
long
for
the
all
male
coloni
to
realiz
that
if
they
want
kitten
they
must
have
doe
they
were
in
such
a
hurri
to
escap
the
warren
that
they
forgot
to
bring
the
mystic
other
half
necessari
for
reproduct
they
came
to
the
same
conclus
that
tribal
unit
have
come
to
for
thousand
of
year
if
they
do
n't
have
someth
they
need
than
they
need
to
liber
it
from
someon
els
the

warren
is

woundwart
he
is
a
brutal
militarist
leader
who
rule

with
an
iron

the
efrafa
happen
to
have
a
plethora
of
doe
and
hazel
and
hi
band
of
intrepid
bunni
believ
they
are
clever
enough
with
the
help
of
some
unusu
alli
to
coax
away
enough
doe
to
insur
the
surviv
of
their
fledgl
societi
thi
set
up
one
of
the
most
puls
pound
showdown
i
've
read
in
a
long
time
display
the
courag
of
the
defend
of
the
alamo
and
the
steadfast
of
the
spartan
at
the
battl
of
thermopyla
i
found
myself
glow
with
the
pride
of
a
particip
white
knuckl
and
all
as
the
watership
down
rabbit
defend
their
home
the
thing
about
thi
book
is
that
you
have
to
hang
in
there
i
have
start
and
stop
thi
book
a
hand
of
time
but
sever
review
on
goodread
convinc
me
i
wa
give
up
on
the
book
too
soon
at
about
page
70
i
could
feel
my
eye
look
over
with
long
at
the
stack
of
book
wait
in
the
wing
as
the
page
stack
up
i
start
to
care
about
thi
band
of
brother
i
wish
that
i
had
read
it
in
time
to
have
share
it
with
my
kid
there
is
much
to
be
discuss
especi
in
regard
to
how
societi
are
structur
about
courag
about
friendship
about
think
outsid
the
box
and
about
the
import
of
how
we
conduct
ourselv
within
our
own
warren/township
if
you
have
kid
young
enough
read
it
to
them
it
will
heighten
the
experi
for
you

i
did
n't
realli
think
so
it
seem
like
it
had
been
too
easi
and
anticlimact
there
were
no
femal
charact
i
also
felt
that
the
theme
of
human
impact
be
neg
and
destruct
wa
a
littl
too
easi
novelist
now
as
then
have
their
environment
impact
as
do
we
all
it
's
easi
to
suggest
that
human
are
degrad
their
environ
harder
to
say
what
should
be
done
about
it
given
that
we
are
all
complicit
in
it
and
adam
make
no
effort
at
all
in
that
direction.littl
did
i
suspect
that
thi
wa
just
the
pre-ambl
to
a
tremend
adventur
in
which
thi
theme
would
be
drop
almost
entir
and
the
focu
would
shift
toward
question
of
leadership
govern
and
the
will
to
power
or
that
the
lack
of
femal
rabbit
would
turn
out
to
be
crucial
to
what
wa
go
to
happen
next.now
a
bunch
of
talk
rabbit
should
realli
be
laughabl
but
they
realli
are
n't
how
doe
adam
acheiv
thi
partli
by
creat
convinc
charact
someth
that
is
of
cours
crucial
to
the
success
of
ani
novel
but
that
doe
n't
resolv
the
absurd
of
talk
rabbit
one
method
adopt
by
adam
is
to
rememb
that
they
are
rabbit
not
just
metamorphos
human
which
one
might
think
would
be
counter-product
but
turn
out
not
to
be
so
these
rabbit
behav
like

where

in

is
a

less

more

even

the

seem

me
to

link
the

what
is
more
fantast
than
a

peopl
talk
about

and
sf
i
would
suggest
that
these

in

on

side
it
is
worth
note
that
the
rabbit
in
thi
book
are
not
anthropomorph
anim
they
do
not
wear
cloth
drive
car
watch
tv
etc.
yet
there
is
also
much
human
in
their
rabbitri
they
can
be
compassion
love
kind
cruel
egotist
melancholi
etc.
these
human
trait
are
believ
portray
as
rabbit
trait
through
the
incred

of
richard

the
prose
is
absolut
beauti
with

awe-inspir
exampl
mani
human
be
say
that
they
enjoy
the

but
what
they
realli
enjoy
is
feel
proof
against
it
for
them
there
is
no
winter
food
problem
they
have
fire
and
warm
cloth
the
winter
can
not
hurt
them
and
therefor
increas
their
sens
of
clever
and
secur
for
bird
and
anim
as
for
poor
men
winter

anoth

be
worth
it
to

around

up

expect
a
relentless
parad
of
death
and
despair
thi
is
n't
what
i
got
ye
thi
is
a
matur
book
and
it
is
realist
and
honest
about
the
rabbit
's
place
in
the
world
and
it
certainli
doe
n't
shi
away
from
the
realiti
of
their

in

i

crush
tragedi

what
i

wa
a
much

balanc
depict
of
the

's

i

disappoint
that
my
expect
did
n't
match
thi
book
's
contents.thi
wa
a
slower
read
for
me
but
thi
i
have
to
admit
can
be
at

in

attribut
to
the
circumst
surround
my
read
of
the
book
i
wa

busi
while

thi
and
the

i

the

did

me
in

multipl
time
as
i
nod
off

structur
it
did
n't
feel
like
a
novel
it
felt
like
a
collect
of
interconnect
stori
or
a
fix-up
until
about
the
halfway
mark
when
we
're
at
long
last
introduc

the
book
's

slow

these

found

they
did

i

thi
book
a
great
deal
and
i
think
it
will
be
one
that
will
stick
in
my

for
year

it
's

to

not

thi

grazi
al

intuito
di
uno
di

che
questa
venga
sterminata
da
alcuni
uomini
che
vogliono

sopra
il

appar
lunghissimo
ma
è
in

molto
breve
il
lettor
è
subito
spinto
a
ragionar
in
termini
"
coniglieschi

e
anch
la
concezion
del
tempo
cambia
prima
di
giunger
al
coll

dove
decidono
di
costruir
la

nuova

di
conigli
incapperà
in
pericoli
più
o
meno
grandi
attraverso
i
loro
occhi
vediamo
il
mondo
da
un
altra
prospettiva
una
prospettiva
che
con
la
nostra
non
ha
nulla
a
che
fare
e
grazi
a
questo
possiamo
imparar
a
capir
un
po
di
più
la
natura
fors
anch
a
rispettarla.inquietant
è
l'episodio
della
conigliera
"
maledetta
"
questo
posto
sembra
molto
accoglient
ma
i
conigli
in
realtà
sono
apatici
vivono
vicinissimi
agli
uomini
e
si
cibano
alla
grand
però
ogni
tanto
qualcuno
scompar
sono
troppo
abituati
a
questo
metodo
di
vita
a
questo
patto
uomo-coniglio
per
cambiar
le
cose
e
aprir
gli
occhi.dopo
questo
le
acqu
sembrano
calmarsi
finalment
i
conigli
hanno
trovato
la
loro
conigliera
vengono
raggiunti
da
due
sopravvissuti
alla
strage
della
loro
vecchia
casa
se
non
che
si
accorgono
di
esser
destinati
all
estinzion
nel
caso
non
provvedano
a
trovar
qualch
femmina
così
part
la
ricerca
anch
grazi
a
un
gabbiano
che
si
fanno
amico
con
l'intelligenza
del
loro
capo
moscardo
gli
unici
conigli
nei
paraggi
sono
quelli
domestici
chiusi
in
gabbia
di
una
fattoria
lì
vicino
gli
altri
appartengono
a
una
grandissima
conigliera
a
due
tre
giorni
di
viaggio

per
questa
conigliera
moscardo
e
nicchio
un
altro
coniglio
tentano
una
sortita
alla
fattoria
per
veder
se
possono
fare
qualcosa
con
i
conigli
domestici
questi
sono
quattro
e
hanno
un
po
paura
a
seguirli
moscardo
promett
di
ritornar
molto
presto
mi
fermo
qui
nel
raccontar
l'episodio
perché
se
no
svelo
tutta
la
trama
tornando
alla
spedizion
per
la
grand
conigliera
che
dà
poi
vita
all
episodio
fulcro
del
romanzo
intendo
analizzar
attentament
la
società
di
quei
conigli

di
essi

è
il
general
vulneraria
semplic
coniglio
capo
?
no
trattasi
di
un
tiranno
ed
efrafa
la
sua
conigliera
non
è
altro
che
una
dittatura
oligarchica
qui
si
inserisc
il
tema
social
del
romanzo
e
spero
di
non
essermi
sbagliato
e
di
non
star
sparando
un
mare
di
stronzat
questa
società
conigliesca
è
retta
da
vulneraria
e
da
una
speci
di
aristocrazia
militar
chiamata
ausla
(
present
quasi
in
tutt
le
coniglier
ma
qui
con
poteri
praticament
assoluti
)
gli
orari
dei
conigli
sono
scanditi
regolarment
nessuno
se
ne
può
andar
chi
tenta
la
fuga
vien
o
ammazzato
o
torturato
se
arrivano
forestieri

arrestati

tempo
ha
organizzato

a
largo
raggio
che

tutta
la
zona
efrafa
è
in
breve
uno
stato
dittatorial
in
miniatura
composto
da
conigli
anziché
da
umani
e
nel
suo
final
fallimento
possiamo
vederci
decin
di
episodi
storici
e
attuali.ultimo
fatto
rilevant
del
romanzo
è
la
bontà
umana
nei
bambini
assent
invec
negli
uomini
i
conigli
reputano
l'uomo
uno
dei
nemici
principali
eppur
sarà
una
bambina
a
compier
un
atto
molto
buono
alla
fine
in
questo
romanzo
che
è
poi
un
odissea
metaforica
dove
al
posto
dei
conigli
possiamo
metter
benisismo
gli
uomini
e
al
posto
degli
animali
più
grandi
i
mostri
omerici
il
tema
del
viaggio
e
della
libertà
di
voler
aver
una
casa
e
un
po
di
pace
sono
elevati
a
"
ricerca
della
felicità
"
e
possiamo
tutti
desiderar
di
esser
conigli
per
goder
dell
'
erbetta
fresca
e
di
tutti
quei
paesaggi
osservati
con
occhi
verament
attenti
-
che
l'autor
ci
descriv
così
splendidament
ricchi
di
colori
ma
anch
di
insidi
e
tutti
vorremmo
viver
in
una
società
i
cui
lacci
siano
meno
allentati
di
quelli
odierni
in
questo
libro
respiriamo
la
libertà
