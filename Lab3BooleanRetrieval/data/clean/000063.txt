let
's
just
say
that
thi
book
is
certainli
one
open
to
a
lot
of
controversi
and
debat
yet
that
is
what
make
it
such
an
interest
read
the
catcher
in
the
rye
certainli
would
n't
be
everyon
's
cup
of
tea
howev
i
find
it
an
excit
and
compel
read
with
a
gallon
of
brutal
realiti
pour
in
along
with
some
humor
contrast
with
moment
of
depress
despit
be
written
in
1951
i
think
mani
teenag
would
be
abl
to
relat
to
the
variou
theme
present
in
the
book
it
is
a
modern
classic
of
the
come
of
age
genr
i
find
the
main
charact
17-year-old
holden
caulfield
absolut
intrigu
and
as
i
read
the
book
it
wa
fascin
to
get
insid
the
head
of
the
strang
rebelli
protagonist
the
book
begin
with
holden
directli
address
you
the
reader
and
he
begin
to
retel
the
event
over
a
three
day
period
from
last
decemb
hi
stori
start
at
pencey
prep
a
prestigi
board
school
fill
with
phoni
as
holden
like
to
call
them
what
strike
me
the
most
is
the
way
saling
creat
the
a
brash
atmospher
from
the
veri
begin
of
the
book
with
holden
be
portray
as
insol
lazi
and
quit
frankli
complet
clueless
about
hi
futur
almost
all
of
the
stori
is
one
long
flashback
of
thi
three
day
period
with
occasion
refer
to
the
present
one
thing
that
set
the
catcher
in
the
rye
apart
from
other
similar
novel
i
think
is
the
fairli
frequent
use
of
profan
be
warn
the
heavi
use
of
colloqui
is
effect
in
make
the
reader
relat
to
the
charact
better
and
make
the
charact
seem
realist
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
're
under
fourteen
i
would
certainli
not
recommend
the
novel
to
you
it
is
n't
onli
the
languag
use
that
make
the
catcher
in
the
rye
unsuit
for
younger
reader
but
also
the
theme
discuss
centr
around
the
idea
of
moral
j.d.
saling
's
novel
is
a
wake-up
call
to
all
teenag
and
in
a
sens
is
an
inspir
read
becaus
it
send
out
the
messag
that
we
should
all
remain
hope
and
true
to
ourselv
teenag
can
relat
to
it
becaus
of
it
complex
theme
of
rebellion
,
ident
and
independ
but
i
would
recommend
you
read
it
befor
you
're
an
adult
otherwis
you
may
have
the
urg
to
slap
holden
for
hi
action
