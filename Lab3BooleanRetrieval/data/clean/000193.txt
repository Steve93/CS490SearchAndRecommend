make
a

both
a

no-brain
and
a
caus
for
great
concern
the
first

wa
a
huge
hit
take
more
than
eight
time
it
budget
at
the
box
offic
and
win
over
critic
and
audienc
alik
with
it
intellig
storytel
and
witti
script
but
with
the
continu
success
of
pixar
first
with
monster
inc.
and
then
find
nemo
you
would
have
been
within
your
right
to
doubt
that
ani
sequel
could
compete.fortun
shrek
2
is
a
great
second
outing
thank
in
part
to
the
continu
presenc
of
andrew
adamson
behind
the
camera
as
a
co-writ
now
as
well
as
co-director
the
film
may
not
be
quit
as
edgi
as
it
predecessor
perhap
due
to
dreamwork
head
honcho
jeffrey
katzenberg
want
to
play
it
safe
to
secur
further
outing
but
the
film
is
everi
bit
as
funni
as
the
first
one
if
not
slightli
moreso
and
continu
to
develop
and
deepen
it
uniqu
fairytal
world.mak
a
sequel
to
ani
film
can
go
one
of
two
way
depend
on
the
attitud
of
the
peopl
behind
it
and
the
potenti
present
in
the
charact
on
the
one
hand
the
film
can
repeat
all
the
basic
rhythm
of
the
first
film
either
with
the
main
charact
be
replac
so
that
the
journey
appear
to
be
new
or
by
the
stake
be
rais
so
that
it
feel
like
the
action
is
more
signific
occasion
thi
approach
work
wonder
as
on
evil
dead
2
but
often
it
result
in
tire
formula
offer
such
as
the
mani
straight-to-video
sequel
produc
by
disney.on
the
other
hand
the
film
can
attempt
to
tell
a
new
stori
with
the
charact
undergo
a
new
challeng
and
more
characterist
of
their
univers
be
reveal
thi
approach
is
harder
to
get
right
but
when
thing
come
togeth
the
result
regularli
outclass
their

the
empir
strike
back
mad
max
2
the
road
warrior
and
the
rescuer
down
under
are
all
exampl
of
thi
approach
work
well
and
now
we
can
add
shrek

to

list.th
basic
principl

the
