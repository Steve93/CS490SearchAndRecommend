late
60
that
hi

from

genr
to
someth
the
literari
critic
were
forc
to
take

thi
new
depth
to
hi
write
wa
partli
a
matter
of
experi
higgin
wa
get
better
at
what
he
wa
do
and
even
60

great
such
as
alastair

had
begun
to
believ
he
had
a
good
futur
but
it
wa
also
prompt
by
a
chanc
encount
with
an

he
told

enjoy
my
write
becaus
i
wrote
the
book

higgin
said
"
but
he
also
told
me
i
could
do
so
much
better
if
i
were
to
start
by
think
of
the
charact
and
let
the
plot
develop
from
them
rather
than
what
i
had
been
do
which
wa
shoehorn
the
charact
into
the
plot
"
the
chang
of
style
paid
off
immedi
with
east
of
desol
the
first

still
high
on

follow
up
with

a
prayer
for

the

option
paid
off

and
then
came
the
game
changer
the
eagl
ha

it
wa
a
strang
time
for

while
he
wa
be
fete
by

"
yet
for
everi

big
him
up
there
seem
to
be
more
tri
to
bring
him
down
at
a
champagn

higgin
overheard
a

that
's

you
could
say
precis
the

about
jane

had
it
right
when
he
said
