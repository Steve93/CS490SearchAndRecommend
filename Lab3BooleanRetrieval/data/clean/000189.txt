it
wa
decid
to
bring
the
stage
version
of
the
lion
king
to
london
i
wa
sadden
to
learn
that
the
lyceum
theatr
wa
found
to
be
the
ideal
venu
for
such
a
lavish
product
i
knew
that
thi
would
mean
that
thi
music
play
would
have
an
extens
run
at
the
theater
and
as
a
result
the
theater
would
be
off
limit
to
me
as
long
as
i
could
not
face
see
it
deject
ooo
i
rememb
that
in
2002
when
i
wa
visit
london
i
decid
that
it
wa
time
that
i
went
insid
the
lyceum
theatr
and
look
around
the
thought
of
have
to
watch
the
lion
king
did
not
fill
me
joy
i
am
sorri
to
say
perhap
the
manag
would
take
piti
on
me
and
allow
me
to
go
insid
just
to
look
you
never
know
your
luck
and
so
i
decid
to
ask
whi
not
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
wa
a
refus
outer
stair
up
to
the
foyer
and
box
offic
i
went
to
the
theater
box
offic
and
ask
if
it
might
be
possibl
to
take
a
look
insid
the
theater
i
strung
them
a
long
tale
about
be
a
visitor
and
want
to
write
about
the
build
on
my
websit
which
i
am
now
do
sinc
it
wa
a
theater
of
some
signific
and
with
a
long
histori
all
of
which
is
true
although
the
staff
wa
pleasant
they
said
that
they
were
not
abl
to
grant
my
request
and
suggest
that
i
buy
a
ticket
to
see
thi
great
show
and
see
the
theater
thi
way
thi
suggest
did
not
sit
well
with
me
i
fear
as
it
wa
not
a
busi
time
all
three
book
clerk
on
duti
began
to
tri
to
persuad
me
to
purchas
a
ticket
the
happi
look
on
their
face
quickli
turn
to
horror
when
i
told
them
exactli
what
i
thought
of
the
film
of
the
lion
king
sadli
they
did
not
hear
my
retel
of
my
delight
of
the
open
sequenc
of
the
stage
show
howev
these
poor
peopl
could
not
believ
their
ear
just
then
the
manag
came
through
a
door
and
into
the
foyer
and
heard
some
of
my
discours
he
too
wa
obvious
horrifi
at
what
he
heard
but
he
wa
evid
undaunt
by
them
he
enter
the
convers
and
eventu
boldli
made
an
offer
to
me
that
actual
wa
appeal

manag
said
that
should
i
buy
a
ticket
and
not
be
enchant
by
the
perform
he
would
gladli
refund
my
money
sure
he
wa
jest
i
quickli
thought
about
hi
offer
and
realiz
that
it
would
inde
allow
me
to
enter
the
theater
and
see
the
decor
which
wa
exactli
what
i
want
sinc
i
wa
certain
not
to

could
not
but
agre
howev
befor
fork
over
my
money
i
had
the
manag
repeat
hi
offer
which
he
did
and
so
an
agreement
wa
made
between
the
manag
and
myself
and
a
ticket
wa
exchang
for
money
and
i
happili
left
the
theater
ooo
that
even
i
took
my
place
in
the
circl
after
roam
around
the
theater
and
examin
the
decor
which
i
found
to
be
a
remark
i
sat
quietli
and
wait
with
the
audienc
to
calm
down
and
for
the
music
to
begin
the
place
wa
fill
with
mother

fell
and
suddenli
the
wail
sound
of
rafiki

burst
forth
to
fill
the

as
she
call
the
anim
to
pride

to
meet
the

then
the
anim
slowli
began
to
enter
the
stage
area
the
audienc
erupt
into
a
wild
applaus
of
appreci
and
i
had
to
agre
that
the
grace
movement
of
the
actor
on

as
giraff
and
the
superbl
eleg
cheetah
were
remark
to
watch
rafiki

the
crowd
love
it
i
wa
impress
as
the
anim
glide
seren
onto
the
stage
and
when
the
eleph
and
the
rhinocer
lope
and
labor
their
way
along
the
central
aisl
to
take
their
place
on
the
stage
thi
realli
wa
a
remark
open
to
a
show
and
one
that
would
be
hard
to
equal
the
onli
thing
that
spoil
thi
spectacular
scene
wa
the
song
the
circl
of
life
i
have
to
confess
that
the
open
sequenc
prove
to
be
as
excit
and
as
appeal
as
it
had
in
1998
when
i
saw
it
on
televis
eventu
the
parent
of
the
futur
lion
king
move
onto
the
stage
along
with
their
cub
the
song
reach
it
crescendo
as
rafiki
the
mandril
took
hold
and
lift
up
the
obviou
doll
pose
as
the
lion
cub
for
all
