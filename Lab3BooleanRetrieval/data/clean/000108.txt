shardik
watership

is
get
the

treatment
although
rather
rueful
about

on

a
godlik
bear
at

had
a
fair
hear
when
it
wa
publish
40
year
ago
“
no
they
were
expect
someth
like
watership
down
and
they
did
n’t
get
it
they
got
thi
rather
difficult
and
savag
novel
shardik
is
a
hard
book
to
read
a
lot
of
peopl
have
said
that
they
had
to
struggl
with
it
but
i
like
it
and
i
read
it
often
”
i
ask
him
what
inspir
the
book
he
ponder
for
a
moment
“
i
ca
n’t

adam
take
the
view
“
a

hi
most
recent
novel
–
daniel
about
a
young
black
slave
in
the
era
of
abolit
–
wa
publish
in
2006
“
it
wa
in
my
mind
a
failur
becaus
i
wa
tri
to
do
what
i
do
n’t
do
–
write
a

novel
for

doe
he
still
write
“
oh
ye
i
’m
write
all
right
”
what
“
sha
n’t

”
he
say
with
a
twinkl
he
then
relent
and
reveal
that
he
’s
write
about
an
ordinari
boy
who
find
himself
on

engag
with
the
spanish
armada
“
that
is
a
veri
good
field
for
fantasi
you
’ve
got
to
get
it
right

i
’ve
got
a
great
respect

i
read

for

they
viva
’d
me
for
40
or
50
minut
as
somebodi
said
afterward
we
gave
him
a
long
viva
in
the
hope
of
pull
him
over
the
line
but
he
would
n’t
realli
hit
the
ball
’
i
could
n’t
hit
the
ball
becaus
i
did
n’t
know
the
answer
to
a
lot
of
the
question
”
henc
perhap
the
allur
of
fantasi
where
there
are
no
right
answer
hi
passion
for
make-believ
wa
stoke
by
the
sort
of
countri
childhood
that
no
longer
exist
he
wa
much
the
youngest
of
three
children
and
in
twenti
berkshir
had
to
entertain
himself
“
i
made
up
a
kingdom
of
my
own
and
i
had
sever
devot
follow
and
we
did
all

it

all
imaginari
i

veri
well
well
they
’re
still
around

”
in
1939
when
hi
studi
at
oxford
were
interrupt
adam
did
hi
best
to
avoid
engag
directli
with
histori
he
opt
for
the
royal
armi
servic
corp
“
i
never
fire
a
gun
at
a
german
or
anyth
like
that
”
he
say
he
share
hi
dna
with
the
rabbit
fiver
–
“
rather
timid
and
not
much
of
a
fighter
i
’m
prepar
to
admit
but
abl
to
contribut
someth
in
the
way
of
intuit
knowledg
”
and
to
complement
that
intuit
knowledg
ha
age
brought
wisdom
“
well
i
’d
be
boast
if
i
said
ye
i
like
to
think
i
’ve
profit
by
experi
and
know
a
thing
or
two
as
they
say
”
would
he
subscrib
to
the
view
that
thing
are
n’t
what
they
use
to
be
“
no
just
the
revers
i
think
thing
have
been
improv
all
the
time
it
’s
a
much
freer
societi
to
the
point
where
one
might
feel
thi
ha
gone
a
bit
too
far
i
mean
befor
the
war
you
were
expect
to
behav
yourself
sexual
you
do
n’t
have
to
now
do
what
you
bloom
well
like
–
and
peopl
do
and
i
think
that
often
ha
veri
veri
bad
result
for
exampl
the
divorc
rate
well
thi
leav
children
in
a
sad
state
”
watership
down
wa
creat
he
say
out
of
a
desir
to
be
a
constant
parent
presenc
–
do
the
school
run
himself
befor
head
to
work
“
i
’ve
got
a
thing
about
that
parent
ought
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
their
children
’s
compani
a
lot
of
them
do
n’t
you
know
”
so
how
far
ha
he
got
with
thi
new
novel
“
oh
it
’s
still
in
my
mind
”
is
he
confid
of
finish
it
“
no
i
’m
not
you
do
n’t
understand
i
may
die
at

moment
i
’m
94
i
’ve
got
to
write
or
i
would
n’t
know
what
to
do
”
doe
he
fear
the
end
“
we
all
do
do
n’t
we
religi
peopl

and
so
on
may
look
