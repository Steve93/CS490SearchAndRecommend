"
near
death
"
scene
mayb
becaus
we
talk
about
how
thi
movi
wa
just
pretend
beforehand
or
mayb
it
wa
just
becaus
they
are
onli
three
and
do
n't
understand
the
concept
of
death
yet
the
monkey
and
the
big
babi
were
creepi
even
to
me
but
the
kid
did
n't
seem
bother
and
those
charact
did
n't
come
up
in
convers
later
i
think
the
movi
wa
a
littl
too
violent
for
small
children
there
were
sever
scene
contain
slap
and
hit
and
gener
throw
around
of
other
littl
kid
wo
n't
understand
whi
some
of
the
charact
are
nice
in
some
scene
and
mean
and
physic
violent
in
other
it
make
it
hard
to
tell
who
the
bad
guy
are
also
i
said
there
wa
too
much
sexi
stuff
but
that
wa
just
becaus
of
the
the
barbie/ken
scene
there
are
also
infer
to
ken
be
gay
becaus
of
hi
love
of
cloth
and
hi
person
groom
but
i
think
all
of
thi
went
