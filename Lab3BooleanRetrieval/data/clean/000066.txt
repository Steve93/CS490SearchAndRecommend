the

thi
is
a
magnific
book
in
mani
way
most
of
which
have
been
comment
on
--
often
brilliantli
--
by
amazon
review
i
would
therefor
like
to
restrict
my
comment
to
the
moral
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
thi
day
view
the
book
with
outrag
even
those
who
admir
the
book
somehow
feel
compel
to
comment
that
they
are
"
disturb
"
by
it
whi
is
thi
let
us
first
examin
the
novel
itself.a
everybodi
know
it
is
the
stori
of
humbert
humbert
a
full-grown
adult
male
--
not
an
old
man
--
who
seduc
a
compliant
twelve-year
old
girl
and
then
goe
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
"
affair
"
with
her
i
put
the
term
"
affair
"
in
quotat
mark
becaus
it
probabl
is
n't
appropri
to
describ
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
femal
child
in
such
term
is
it
safe
to
say
that
most
ration
human
be
disapprov
of
such
relationship
it
is
certainli
safe
to
say
that
nabakov
--
and
hi
narrat
--
know
that
such
relationship
are
wrong
thi
is
import
the
tale
is
not
onli
told
in
the
context
of
a
moral
univers
it
is
also
told
by
a
charact
who
is
in

oh
he
make
a

here
and
there
about
some
mediev
king
marri

clearli
hi
