coming-of-adult-ag

that
is
to

woolverton

i.e.
featur
charact

from

though
it
remain
to
be
seen
if
glover
will

goe
for

as
for
newcom
we
’ve
heard
that
sacha

cohen
ha
been
approach
for
a
villain
role
which
mean
it
’s
possibl
that
he
and

follow
“

you
see
a

i
like

the

i
could

“
bobin
went
on
to
discuss
the
influenc
of
carol
’s
write
on
english
pop
cultur
as
well
as
voic
hi
appreci
for
the
origin
alic
book
as
social
satir
inde
over
the
year
there
’s
been
more
widespread
academ
studi
on
the
social
commentari
aspect
of
carol
’s
work
–
move
away
from
the
psycho-analyt
interpret
of
wonderland
and
it
inhabit
that
is
to
say
it
’ll
be
interest
to
see
if
bobin
’s
alic
in
wonderland
sequel
play
up
the
satir
aspect
of
the
properti
more
than
either
burton
’s
movi
or
disney
’s
1951
anim
featur
did
anyway
if
noth
els
alic
in
wonderland
2
will
look
differ
than
burton
’s
film
sinc
oscar-win
art
director
robert
stromberg
–
who
is
busi
finish
post-product
on
hi
directori
debut
i.e.
disney
’s
malefic
–
ha
been
replac
by
fellow
oscar-win
visual
artist
dan
hennah
the
latter
wa
the
supervis
art
director
on
peter
jackson
’s
lord
of
the
ring
trilog
and
product
design
on
jackson
’s
hobbit
film
–
as
far
as
hi
work
on
the
alic
sequel
will
go
bobin
simpli
teas
that
the
film
is
set
in
“
differ
part
of
underland
so
it
ha
a
slightli
more
human
world
”
burton
’s
alic
in
wonderland
had
inkl
of
an
action
movi
but
wa
by
and
larg
bigger
on
have
atmospher
than
narrative-dr
bobin
indic
that
the
same
approach
will
be
carri
over
in
hi
sequel
“
you
wan
na
creat
a
world
where
you
’re
happi
to
spend
two
hour
of
your
life
”
along
with
the
previou
instal
’s
use
of
3d
for
ad
effect
“
alic
is
in
a
victorian
fantasi
land
and
nowher
suit
3d
better
than
that
there
’s
no
limit
to
new
idea
and
what
you
can
do
but
also
at
the
same
time
you
have
thi
great
palett
of
victoriana
to
use
to
creat
a
fantast
world
and
that
to
me
is
veri
fun
becaus
i
did
histori
at
univers
my
wife
is
a
historian
histori
’s
my
thing
for
me
it
’s
an
opportun
to
tri
and
recreat
the
world
i
love
from
the
past
in
thi
realli
interest
way
”
all
in
all
burton
’s
alic
in
wonderland
is
one
of
those
film
that
seem
to
split
audienc
–
mani
peopl
enjoy
it
visual
razzle-dazzl
and
play
spin
on
carol
’s
idiosyncrat
fantasi
world
while
other
feel
the
film
is
littl
more
than
a
soulless
3d
cgi-fest
without
enough
of
burton
’s
mad
creativ
touch
and
heart
in
other
word
there
’s
arguabl
a
fair
amount
of
room
for
improv
on
bobin
’s
sequel
as
far
as
pleas
everyon
