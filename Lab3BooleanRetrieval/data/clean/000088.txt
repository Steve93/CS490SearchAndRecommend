it
's
right
up
there
amongst
my
favorit
of
a
veri
eclect

whi
well
firstli
and
i
have
to
say
veri
importantli
it
's
taken
from
the
finest
piec
of
modern
literatur
i
've
read
umberto

's
novel
ha
such
mammoth
scope
of
subject

it
is
wa
alway
go
to
be
extrem
hard
to
put

dune
anyon

and
annaud
certainli
doe
n't
succeed
in
everi
way

my
lord

give
it
a
