i
love

i
think
thi
is
my
favorit
novel
of
all

which
is
not

a
whole
lot
becaus
there
is
a
ton
of

gregg
say
that
joell

she
'll

i
have
on
the
agenda
today
is
to
go
to
the
gym
and
then
off
to
keracik
's
american
lit
class
it
is
not
a
bad
class
although
it
is
nowher
close
to
gender
studi
with
halberstam
or
davidoff
's
survey
of
modern
postmodern
last
semest
now
that
wa
a
class
it
blew
my
mind
so
mani
thing
to
think
about
the
read
in
american
lit
ha
been
okay
but
we
've
been
assign
to
read
catcher

it
is
terribl
ca
n't

i
ever
like
thi

the
book
ha
no

there
is
liter
noth
go

it
is
just
one
rote
cliché
after
anoth
he
think
he
is

but
in
realiti
he
is
just
anoth
tire
represent
of
rootless
stereotyp
masculin
and
gender
essenti
complet
inan
and
without
mean
i
think
my

will
use

acker-styl
postmodernist
techniqu
to
show

simplist
thi

get
the
time
at
all
it
’s
damn
depress
i
swear
to
god
it
is
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
you
probabl
could
n’t
even
talk
to
a
phoni
writer
on
the
phone
you
would
just
end
up
talk
to
hi
butler
or
some
snobbish
person
like
that
and
ask
if
they
would
give
the
writer
your
messag
he
probabl
would
n’t
even
do
it
the
thing
with
guy
like
that
is
that
they
will
never
give
writer
your
messag
that
’s
someth
that
annoy
the
hell
out
of
me
turn
out
thi
is
still
a
damn
good
book
saling
kid
is
a
great
writer
he
realli
is
mayb
i
’m
still
just
an
angst-ridden
sonuvabitch
but
thi
part
kill
me
“
all
the
kid
kept
tri
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
and
so
wa
old
phoeb
and
i
wa
sort
of
afraid
she
’d
fall
off
the
goddam
hors
but
i
did
n’t
say
anyth
or
do
anyth
the
thing
with
kid
is
if
they
want
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
and
not
say
anyth
if
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
but
it
’s
bad
if
you
say
anyth
to
them
”
p.
211i
’ll
bet
everyon
is
go
to
think
that
i
’m
just
horsin
’
around
or
tri
to
be
all
sexi
talk
like
thi
the
reason
for
thi

is
becaus
a

i
’ll
bet
that
they

it
realli
is
that

about

now
i
just
hope
that
no
one
write
“

the
thing
with

that

here
is

the

can

it

the
kind
of
crap
that
we
“
adult
”
like
to
slosh
around
in
the
barney
beat
of
sever
year

anoth
symptom
of
our

adolesc
our
inabl
to
ride
the

disillus
into

harbor
of
adulthood

as
though
flail
around
in

storm
and
rage
at

wind
were
in
themselv
mark
of
distinct
and
a
superior
sensibl
i
rememb
a
news
stori
about
a
woman
in
a
barney
costum
be
serious
injur
when
a
rabid
and
probabl
drunken
anti-barney
fanat
attack
the
big
purpl
dinosaur
at
some
public
event
now
i
do
n’t
know
the
age
of
the
barney-beat
but
the
act
itself
is
a
suprem
adolesc
one
in
which
the
impuls
respons
to
disillusion
is
to
lash
out
at
those
symbol
of
childhood
which
made
the
biggest
dupe
of
us
at
the
dawn
of
adolesc
when
barney
begin
to
appear
cloy
and
fals
it
seem
natur
to
want
to
beat
up
on
him
as
though
it
wa
barney
himself
who
pull
one
over
on
us
instead
of
our
own
poignant
and
necessari
misapprehens
of
the
natur
of
thing
i
could
see
holden
caulfield
beat
up
on
barney
at
least
rhetor
and
i
could
see
holden
caulfield
miss
barney
as
he
miss
all
the
“
phoni
”
at
the
end
of
the
book
but
i
can
not
see
holden
caulfield
accept
the
postlapsarian
barney
on
new
term
as
a
figur
who
is
meant
for
children
and
not
for
him
for
all
hi
touch
pose
about
want
to
be
the
“
catcher
in
the
rye
”
what
holden
realli
want
is
not
to

even

you

is
a
seriou
stretch
but
i
must
admit
that
these
book
do
in

fill
me
with
angst
!!!
...
so
what
happen
to
all
of
the
preconceiv
notion
i
had
befor
i
start
read
thi
book
instead
i
found
myself
complet
drawn
into
the
rich
nuanc
stori
of
holden
caulfield
i
found
myself
empath
with
caulfield
almost
from
the
begin
someth
i
did
not
expect
to
do
hi
annoy
pseudo
rebelli
and
just
do
n't

exterior

obvious
manufactur

hide

serious
sad

i
wa
transfix
on
find
the
real
holden
caulfield
despit
the

be
written
in

the

wa

abl

surfac

deeper

to

infus
that
kind
of
nuanc
into
the
spars
prose
of
caulfield
’s
narr
wa
noth
short
of
brilliant
in
my
opinion
caulfi
is
lazi
he
is
stubborn
he
is
immatur
he
is
unfocus
he
is
untruth
he
is
danger
short-sight
and
he
is
lost
in
hi
own
world
or
unrealist
expect
sound
like
that
could
certainli
be
a
not
unsubstanti
portion
of
the
male
16
year
old
popul
howev
after
read
thi
book
i
learn
a
few
other
thing
about
holden
that
i
though
were
fascin
and
that
are
not
as
often
discuss
:1
he
is
desper
lone
he
even
goe
so
far
as
ask
hi
cab
driver
to
join
him
for
a
drink
2
he
is
gener
with
hi
time
and
hi
thing
he
write
an
essay
for
hi
roommat
despit
be
upset
with
him
and
even
let
him
borrow
hi
jacket
3
he
is
extrem
sensit
and
long
for
an
emot
rather
than
just
a
physic
commit
he
mention
sever
time
hi
need
to
“
be
in
love
”
in
order
to
be
physic
and
hi
experi
with
the
prostitut
certainli
bear
thi
out
4
he
is
intellig
despit
be
lazi
and
unfocus
holden
display
great
insight
and
intellig
regard
book
he
ha
read
and
display
at
the
museum
and
5
despit
be
unabl
to
process
it
correctli
he
is
full
of
compass
and
ha
a
deep
capac
for
love
which
he
show
most
notabl
for
hi
sister
thi
wa
one
of
the
most
power
part
of
the
stori
for
me
as
it
wa
holden
’s
desir
to
avoid
hurt
phoeb
that
keep
him
from
run
away
at
the
end
of
the
book
take
all
of
the
good
and
the
bad
togeth
i
wa
left
with
the
feel
that
holden
is
an
adolesc
on
the
cusp
of
adulthood
who
is
achingli
afraid
of
the
loss
of
hi
childhood
and
the
respons
and
commit
that
he
see
as
requir
to
make
it
in
the
“
adult
”
world
he
is
compassion
intellig
and
deepli
emot
and
yet
is
unabl
or
unwil
to
focu
that
energi
on
those
step
that
he
see
as
lead
him
away
from
hi
“
happi
memori
of
childhood
”
and
closer
to
the
“
scari
world
of
the
adult
”
i
think
thi
is
superbl
shown
in
holden
's
express
dream
of
want
to
be
the
“
catcher
in
the
rye
”
quick
side
note
i
had
no
idea
what
the
titl
to
the
book
refer
to
until
i
just
read
the
book
here
is
a
person
so
afraid
of
grow
up
and
so
avers
to
give
into
the
pain
and
sad
that
he
see
as
the
result
of
becom
an
adult
that
he
want
noth
more
than
to
spend
hi
life
protect
other
from
lose

of

a

a
littl
mad
into
each
one
real
peopl
are
almost
never
quit
as
bore
as
modernist
depict
becaus
everyon
ha
at
least
some
abil
to
surpris
you.saling
's
world
is
desatur
emot
and
moment
seep
into
one
anoth
indistinct
as
the
memori
of
a
drunken
parti
littl
import
is
grant
to
event
or
thought
but
simpli
pass
by
each
duli
talli
by
an
author
in
the
role
of
court
reporter.what
is
interest
about
thi
book
is
not
that
it
is
realist
bland
but
that
it
is
artifici
bland
yet
as
ridicul
a
concept
as
that
is
it
still
take
itself
entir
in
earnest
never
acknowledg
the
humor
of
it
own
blase
hyperbole.thi
allow
the
book
to
draw
legion
of
fan
from
all
of
the
ridicul
dull
peopl
who
take
themselv
as
serious
as
holden
take
himself
they
read
it
not
as
a
parodi
of
bland
egot
but
a
celebr
pois
to
inspir
all
the
bland
egotist
who
have
result
from
the
new
egalitarian
in
art
poetri
music
and
academia.thos
same
folk
who
treat
ration
and
intellectu
fervor
like
a
fashion
to
be
follow
imagin
that
the
onli
thing
requir
to
be
brilliant
is
to
mimic
the
appear
and
manner
of
the
brilliant
as
if
black
beret
were
the
caus
of
poetic
inspir
and
not
mere
a
symptom.on
benefit
of
thi
is
that
one
can
gener
sniff
out
pompou
faux
intellectu
by
the
sign
that
they
hold
up
holden
as
a
sort
of
messian
figur
anyon
who
mark
out
holden
as
a
role-model
is
either
a
delud
teen
with
an
inflat
sens
of
entitl
or
is
tri
to
reliv
the
day
when
they
were.but
what
is
more
interest
is
that
those
who
idol
holden
tend
to
be
those
who
most
misunderstand
him
upon
close
inspect
he
's
not
depress
not
consum
with
ennui
or
an
existenti
crisi
he
's
actual
suffer
from
shell
shock
--
now
known
as
post-traumat
stress
disord
the
way
he
think
about
hi
brother
's
and
classmat
's
death
--
go
over
the
detail
again
and
again
in
hi
mind
but
with
no
emot
connect
--
it
's
not
symptomat
of
depress
but
of
psycholog
trauma
he
is
stuck
in
a
cycl
unabl
to
process
event
go
over
them
again
and
again
but
never
abl
to
return
to
normalcy.it
take
a
certain
kind
of
self-cent
prick
to
look
at
someon
's
inabl
to
cope
with
the
realiti
of
death
and
think
hey
that
's
just
like
my
mild
depress
over
how
my
parent
wo
n't
buy
me
a
newer
ipod
it
's
not
an
unusu
stanc
in
american
literatur
--
there
's
an
arrog
detach
in
american
thought
which
ha
becom
less
and
less
pertin
as
the
world
grow
and
chang
as
recent
as
the
road
we
have
american
author
compar
a
difficult
father-son
relationship
to
the
pain
and
turmoil
of
an
african
civil
war
survivor
--
and
win
award
for
display
their
insensit
arrogance.perhap
it
's
time
we
woke
up
and
realiz
that
the
well-f
despond
of
the
white
man
should
not
be
equat
with
a
lifetim
of
death
starvat
war
and
trauma
both
physic
and
emot
and
as
for
saling
--
a
real
suffer

who
wa
one
of
the
first

to

who
describ
how
you
can
never

the

and
trust
me
there
are
dozen
of
time
where
thi
occur
one
specif

in

8
he
is
talk
to
a
cab
driver
who
is
act
like
a

holden
say
to
the

“

he
slow
down
hi

slowli
but
sure
drift
out

to
thi

saling
refus

offer
to
have
‘

’
put
on
the

hollywood
screen
saling

ex

joyc

even
onc
said
that
“
the

would
have
been

”
it
seem
to
me
that
it
is
no
coincid
that
holden
is
no
fan
of
hollywood
and
that
saling
in
real
life
and
doe
n’t
want
anyth
to
do
with
turn
hi
popular
novel
into
a
movi
holden
say
“
if
there
’s
one
thing
i
hate
it
’s
the

do
n’t
even
mention

”
sinc
i
have
learn
more
about
saling
’s
person
life
i
recogn
a
lot
of
saling
’s
person
in
holden
in
the
stori
holden
ha
overbear
parent
much
like
saling
’s
parent
saling
said
hi
mother
wa
over
protect
saling
ha
one
sibl
a
sister
which
is
iron
becaus
it
is
holden
’s
sister
phoeb
who
ha
a
profound
influenc
on
holden
he
often
talk
about
her
with
veri
high
regards.holden
is
not
a
charact
who
tri
to
sugarcoat
the
way
he
see
the
fake
around
him
holden
make
fun
of
the
peopl
around
him
often
say
thing
like
“
you
would
’ve
puke
”
and
“
it
wa
veri
phoni
”
i
think
that
is
anoth
one
of
the
reason
i
like
hi
charact
so
much
for
exampl
he
is
quit
upset
with
the
fact
that
hi
brother
d.b.
is
sell
hi
work
to
hollywood
instead
of
use
hi
talent
for
hi
own
pleasur
holden
even
say
that
hi
brother
is
hi
favorit
author
saling
himself
is
a
man
who
wrote
for
hi
own
pleasur
and
like
i
made
a
similar
connect
to
a
girl
name
salli
that
holden
like
in
the
book
to
a
real
life
lover
of
saling
’s
name
oona
oona
o’neil
wa
self-absorb
and
stuck
up
accord
to
saling
yet
he
still
phone
and
wrote
her
letter
quit
often
holden
’s
“
oona
”
in
the
stori
wa
a
girl
name
salli
hay
though
he
found
her
extrem
irrit
he
thought
she
wa
veri
attract
as
well
after
spend
a
day
with
her
he
point
out
about
a
dozen
instanc
where
he
thought
she
wa
be
“
phone
as
hell
”
by
the
end
of
their
onli
meet
in
the
book
holden
say
to
salli
“
you
give
me
a
royal
pain
in
the
ass
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
”
the
real
life
oona
o’neil
end
up
break
it
off
with
saling
and
marri
the
famou
actor
charli
chaplin.despit
holden
be
a
sixteen
year
old
teenag
boy
he
act
much
older
than
hi
age
one
time
in
the
stori
he
ha
the
chanc
to
be
with
a
prostitut
but
instead
of
act
like
a
pig
he
start
to
feel
sorri
for
her
and
instead
tri
to
have
a
convers
with
her
he
even
offer
to
pay
her
for
good
convers
instead
of
for
sex
he
also
stay
alon
in
hotel
randomli
drink
at
bar
and
club
often
and
even
tell
peopl
he
’s
older
than
he
realli
is
but
the
reason
i
find
hi
charact
matur
and
intellectu
is
for
other
reasons.holden
doe
not
hold
money
or
materi
thing
to
be
realli
import
he
is
more
excit
to
hang
out
with
hi
kid
sister
than
he
is
ani
other
time
in
the
entir
book
he
is
content
with
someth
that
would
probabl
be
bore
to
other
guy
hi
age.lik
mani
teenag
holden
is
often
depress
the
way
he
deal
with
it
most
time
actual
break
my
heart
in
a
way
he
like
to
talk
to
hi
deceas
kid
brother
alli
he
will
take
a
real
event
that
he
can
rememb
where
he
wa
talk
with
him
and
pretend
he
is
talk
to
him
again
he
say
“
i
start
talk
out
loud
to
alli
i
do
that
sometim
when
i
get
veri
depress
”
it
is
realli
veri
heart
wrench
to
hear
holden
talk
about
hi
brother
one
of
my
favorit
moment
in
the
book
is
when
holden
and
phoeb
are
talk
in
phoeb
’s
room
and
she
point
out
that
holden
doe
n’t
like
anyth
holden
respond
quickli
by
say
“
i
like
alli
and
i
like
do
what
i
’m
do
right
now
sit
here
with
you
and
talk
and
think
about
stuff
…
”
phoeb
say
to
holden
“
alli
’s
dead-you
alway
say
that
if
somebodi
’s
dead
and
everyth
and
in
heaven
then
it
is
n’t
realli
--
”
holden
interrupt
her
with
hi
final
comeback
“
i
know
he
’s
dead
do
n’t
you
think
i
know
that
i
can
still
like
him
though
ca
n’t
i
just
becaus
somebodi
’s
dead
you
do
n’t
just
stop
like
them
for
god
’s
sake
especi
if
they
were
about
a
thousand
time
nicer
than
the
peopl
you
know
that
’re
aliv
and
all
”
one
of
the
most
beauti
thing
about
‘
the
catcher
in
the
rye
’
is
the
way
saling
use
symbol
from
holden
’s
red
hunt
hat
to
jane
gallagh
’s
checker
play
techniqu
saling
wrap
up
more
than
meet
the
eye
into
thing
you
never
would
have
dream
the
main
thing
that
drew
me
into
thi
stori
is
the
real
of
holden
’s
charact
he
is
a
teenag
boy
with
a
teenag
boy
’s
mind
but
seem
to
have
far
more
common
sens
than
anyon
els
around
him
he
is
not
a
jock
he
is
not
a
math
whiz
or
a
scienc
whiz
he
is
not
realli
interest
in
sport
he
sort
of
make
up
hi
own
categori
a
categori
that
i
call
‘
the
genuin
’
he
is
on
hi
own
a
lot
and
love
it
at
first
but
happi
and
love
are
meant
to
be
share
with
other
it
ha
a
much
less
mean
when
by
itself
and
he
realiz
it
by
the
end
of
the
novel
he
is

littl
by
littl
throughout
the
whole

he
realiz
what

remind

find
a
place
where
peopl
are
more
vulner
open
and
honest
with
each

even
if
they
win
over

…
how
could
life
ever
feel
as
full
after
that
brief
moment
share
with
other
who
complet
understand
at
the
same
time
the
point
of
those
meet
is
to
help
peopl
live
not
just
free
from
drug
but
mayb
free
to
live
in
the
mundan
free
to
enjoy
the
danc
of
life
the
need
of
the
soul
balanc
with
the
chore
too
thi
doe
n’t
have
to
be
depress

it
doe
requir

or
a
sens
of
a
time
and
place
for
everyth
includ
the
day-to-day
catcher
in
the
rye
touch
on
some
of
these
question
holden
struggl
with
grow
up
he
see
everyth
as
meaningless
and
adult
as
predict
and
fake
i

the

mayb
not
just
right
from
wrong
but
the
loss
of
dream
grow
up
seem
to
requir
holden
while
at
the
museum
that
is
exactli
the
same
as
it
wa
when
he
wa
a
kid
say
he
like
it
becaus
each
time
you
visit
the
onli
thing
that
would
be
differ
would
be
you
…
and
goe
on
to
say
certain
thing
they
should
stay
the
way
they
are
you
ought
to
be
abl
to
stick
them
in
one
of
those
big
glass
case
and
just
leav
them
alon
i
know
that
's
imposs
but
it
’s
too
bad
anyway
one
thing
i
thought
of
to
help
explain
holden
's
struggl
with
grow
up
is
thi
coffe
when
i
wa
a
kid
i
use
to
smell
my
dad
's
coffe
that
strong
sugary-sweet
smell
of
roast
bean
you
wait
for
your
chanc
to
be
let
in
on
thi
excel
secret
think
it
is
just
the
caffein
that
is
prevent
your
parent
from
give
you
a
tast
final
they
do
and
then
all
your
dream
of
that
sweet
flavor
come
crash
down
it
's
wreck
coffe
is
n't
at
all
what
you
thought
it
wa
that
is
until
the
day
you
give
it
anoth
chanc
you
start
to
be
abl
to
smell
and
tast
the
differ
tone
coffe
ha
you
can
appreci
it
for
it
vari
and
almost
live
flavor
you
see
…
coffe
is
n't
bad
it
just
wa
n't
what
you
alway
thought
the
key
is
in
find
the
hidden
flavor
and
get
over
the
fact
that
it
will
never
tast
as
sweet
as
it
smell
i
think
holden
struggl
with
the
initi
shock
that
although
life
is
more
bitter
than
it
smell
or
than
you
think
it
will
be
there
are
the
hidden
joy
and
sweet
flavor
that
make
it
almost
better!thi

out
to
answer
ani
of
the
question

what

doe

make
he
's
been

sinc
the
mid-1960
befor
i
wa
even
born
a

case
could
be
made
that
he
truli
die
in

when
he
start
stalk
elain
joyc
on
the
set
of
1980

mr.
merlin
and
yet
...
i
still
clung
to
thi
still
technic
live
legend
as
if
he
were
some
kind
of
talisman
i
could
wear
around
my

a
good

charm
to

off

all

soulless
dreck
who
popul
thi

write

on

equival
after
return
for

minut
to

job
which
--
when
you
realli
get
right
down

is
just
anoth
way
of
kill
time
until
i
join
saling
in

i
start
get
all
funny-feel
about
it
at
the
risk
of
sound
like
an
adult
contemporari
power
ballad
written
by
jim
steinman
with
synthes
violin
in
the
background
i
began
to
feel
as
if
my
adolesc
had
final
come
to
an
end
i
guess
it
's
about
time
i
'm
thirty-eight
year
old
and
yet
i
look
at
the
peopl
who
are
my
age
--
hell
who
are
even
much
younger
than
i
am
--
and
who
appear
in
all
particular
to
be
adult
and
i
grow
frightened/alarm
that
they
've
graduat
to
the
next
level
they
're
mate
and
spawn
and
draw
up
will
and
complet
their
own
tax
return
and
invest
money
and
deal
grace

or
with
stoicism
with
the
death
of
friend

even
some
of

it
’s
also
phoni

so
what
do
i
think
about
the
madman
exploit
of
old
holden
caufield
perhap
one
of
the
most
acclaim
protagonist
in
all
of
american
literatur
no
terribl
much
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
time
i
’ve
read
thi
book
i
want
to
kill
myself
holden
’s
alway
say
thing
like
that
i
mean
if
you
were
to
wear
one
blue
sock
and
one
red
sock
and
mayb
slowli
skin
your
shrivelfig
under
the
comfort
cotton
of
a
green

he
’d
say
someth
like
“
god
how
i
hate
how
that
guy
mess
around
with
hi
sock
it
make
me
want
to
kill
myself
”
in
that
case
you
’d
better
hope
you
’re
at
least
in
possess
of
a
decent
valis
lest
that
bastard
caulfield
spread
some
more
wrath
upon
you
for
your
clearli
inferior
luggag
that
guy
he
realli
crack
me
up
i
never
realli

holden
is

with
all
the
talent

lack
the
ambit
to
make
a
notabl

on

which
hold
them
back
but
you
grow
up

onli
to
acknowledg
you
have
no

still
have
no
ambit

instead
of

you

what
they
fail

that
the

itself
is
that
such

useless
worthless

for

there

the

caulfield
also
admit

see
a
certain
disgust
with
the
phoni

organ
religion
set
against

while
thi

share
with

a
contempt
for

it
is
not
a
simpl
repudi
of
religion
in

of
unrestrain
sexual
caulfield
doe
reject
most
of
the
adult
world
he
encount
as
utterli
phoni
but
he
doe
not
follow
the
stock
pattern
laid
down
by
earlier
modernist
caulfield
question
it
all
perhap
despis
hollywood
abov
everyth
else.so
what
doe
caulfield
accept
after
reject
all
of
adult

innoc
the
onli
thing
that
make
thi

most

of

is
a
poignant
plea
for

for
all
the

scandal
about
the

there
is
much
to
be
admir
by
the

saling
pull

about

about

and
especi
the

of
alien
and
standoffish
that
come
to
so
mani
at
that
age
no
matter
when
in
histori
we
're
talk
about.th
argument
for
it
be
a
classic
the
argument
for
thi
be
a
classic
is
a
clean
and
simpl
one
--
it
is
demonstr
the
veri
first
book
in
histori
to
establish
the
confession
young
adult
genr
one
that
ha
grown
in
our
modern
time
to
accommod
ten
of
thousand
of
book
and
million
of
grate
teen
fan
befor
catcher
in
the
rye
it
fan
say
there
were
onli
two
type
of
stori
consid
appropri
for
younger
reader
--
either
moralist
tale
that
veri
sternli
taught
right
from
wrong
or
the
kind
of
psuedo-sci
babbl
mysteri
like
i
wa
mention
last
week
when
i
wa
review
20,000
leagu
under
the
sea
saling
wa
the
veri
first
person
to
publish
a
book
about
a
teen
written
from
the
teen
's
point
of
view
himself
a
veri
raw
point
of
view
that
contain
sex
filth
curs
galor
and
all
the
other
prurient
stuff
that
come
with
peek
insid
a
16-year-old
boy
's
head
it
wa
a
breakthrough
of
the
modernist
era
fan
claim
one
of
those
semin
project
that
broke
the
ground
for
all
the
naturalist
book
and
film
in
the
'50
'60
and
'70
that
came
afterward
oh
and
if
thi
were
n't
enough
it
just
also
happen
to
be
the
most
censor
book
in
the
histori
of
the
unit
state
as
well
as
a
person
favorit
of
both
mark
david
chapman
who
kill
john
lennon
and
john
hinckley
jr
who
shot
ronald
reagan
these
fact
alon
almost
guarante
it
a
spot
on
ani
list
of
classics.th
argument
against
the
main
argument
against
thi
be
a
classic
seem
to
be
that
it
's
becom
a
victim
of
it
own
success
inde
catcher
in
the
rye
ha
been
so
influenti
over
the
decad
it
critic
say
an
entir
genr
of
salingeresqu
work
now
exist
which
like
i
said
is
more
formal
known
as
confession
young
adult
mani
book
of
which
are
actual
much
better
than
the
origin
that
start
them
all
after
all
let
's
admit
it
catcher
in
the
rye
ha
it
problem
one
typic
of
ani
young
and
inexperienc
writer
which
saling
wa
when
first
pen
thi
just
as
one
good
exampl
there
are
onli
so
mani
time
you
can
use
the
word
g-ddam
in
one
stori
befor
it
becom
a
self-parodi
joke
like
mani
of
the
book
be
review
in
thi
essay
seri
i
do
n't
think
there
's
a
singl
human
out
there
who
would
deni
thi
novel
's
histor
import
but
that
's
not
what
we
're
tri
to
determin
here
with
the
cclap
100
but
rather
whether
it
's
a
book
you
person
should
read
befor
you
die.mi
verdict
so
imagin
my
shock
when
i
found
myself
finish
thi
book
and
say
to
myself
my
god
--
jd
saling
is
basic
judi
blume
with
more
curs
or
to
be
complet
fair
i
guess
that
should
be
word
--
my
god
judi
blume
is
basic
jd
saling
with
jew
and
menstruat
i
guess
i
had
been
expect
a
lot
more
given
what
a
supernatur
high
regard
thi
book
ha
among
such
a
larg
swath
of
the
gener
popul
i
wa
expect
it
to
not
onli
be
a
good
young
adult
novel
which
it
admittedli
is
but
also
someth
that
wa
go
to
reveal
some
sort
of
transcend
truth
about
the
world
to
me
as
a
fully-grown
adult.
...
it
doe
n't
thi
is
just
a
good
young
adult
novel
and
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
know
that
go
into
it
that
unless
you
're
a
teen
yourself
when
you
read
it
there
realli
is
n't
go
to
be
anyth
too
terribl
origin
or
groundbreak
found
in
thi
manuscript
in
fact
you
could
argu
that
saling
wa
quit
smart
to
basic
wall
himself
off
from
the
press
and
gener
public
after
thi
book
and
never
publish
again
he
's
still

the
way
for
those
who
do
n't

reputedli
live
a

أضاف
للعمل
بعدا
أسطوريا
و
انتظرت
ان

قد

بأسلوب
سرد
مركب

بأسلوب
تغلب
عليه
الصيغة
الفلسفية
أو
عمل
يسمى
بالأساس
كتاب
أفكار
تتخذها
الأجيال
كمانشيتات
و
مبادىء
تسير
عليها
...
لكنى
وجدت
العمل
قد
كتب
ببساطة
و
فى
نفس
الوقت
بعمق
لم
أكن
أتوقع
ان
تأتى
بهذا
الشكل.بداية
الرواية
بضمير
المتكلم
،
يحاول
الراوى
خلق
صديق
افتراضى
يتحدث
اليه
بين
حين
وآخر
،
من
الممكن
أن
يكون
أنا
أو
أنت
أو
انتِ
...
كأنه
بذلك
يحاول
كسر
حاجز
الوحده
و
العزلة
التى
فرضت
عليه
أو
فرضها
على
نفسه
جرّاء
سخطه
و
نقمته
على
المجتمع.الرواية
تتخللها
شتائم
آتية
من
فتى
مراهق
ربما
لم
تمر
صفحة
إلا
و
حلاّها
بشتيمة
له
أو
لغيره
كاسرا
بها
حاجز
المجتمع
المثالى
المحافظ
ليقول
أننا
رغم
ذلك
لم
نكن
أبدا
مثاليين
ربما
ندعى
المثالية
و
من
الإدعاء
يتخلق
الزيف
كقنبلة
عنقودية.فتى
مراهق
يرسب
فى
مدرسته
و
يتنقل
من
مدرسة
لخرى
و
لا
يجد
غير
الزيف
فى
زملائه
العاطلين
عن
أى
موهبة
و
الحمقى
الذين
يحاولون
استعراض
مواهبهم
فى
علاقات
عاطفية
فاشلة
و
تفوقهم
فى
مواد
دراسية
مملة
و
غير
جديرة
بالنفع
تبعث
على
الغثيان
...
و
مدرسين
يدّعون
الحكمة
و
تتجمد
عقولهم
على
تفاصيل
موادهم
الدراسية
الذين
يدرسونها
بميكانيكية
بغيضة
آه
نعم
كذلك
فى
الشارع
و
الفنادق
التى
ارتادها
مهجورا
من
المجتمع
بارادته
و
الفتيات
اللاتى
صاحبهن
فى
المسارح
أو
السينمات
او
سائقى
التاكسيات
كلهم
يضعون
موادا
تجميلية
على
وجوههم
و
يضعون
أقنعة
تخفى
باطنهم
الحقيقى
و
المزيف
...
يفتعلون
السعادة
و
يرصعون
حياتهم
بلآلىء
التقوى
و
اتباح
الرب
فى
جميع
خطواتهم
حتى
لو
لم
يكونوا
متدينين
أصلا.لم
يكن
سخطه
أبدا
مكتملا
...
خرج
من
دائرة
السخط
أخته
الصغيرة
فيب
و
أخوه
المتوفى
صغيرا
"
آلى
"
كبراءة
تتبدّى
فى
الطفولة
التى
لم
تتدنس
بعد
و
لم
تظهر
عليها
أعراض
الحضارة
...
كانت
مقاطع
شاعرية
جدا
و
حيوية
و
مليئة
بالعاطفة
الفياضة
عندما
يتحدث
عن
أخته
فيب
و
أخيه
آلى
الذى
مات
صغيرا
كأنه
هو
العالم
الذى
يريده
و
الذى
كان
يريد
أن
يهرب
اليه
عند
حافة
المدينة
يعمل
أى
عمل
كعامل
بنزين
مثلا
مدعيا
أنه
اخرس
و
أبكم
حتى
يوفر
عليه
الكلمات
الزائفة
التى
تصدر
عن
الزبائن
أو
الجيران

لكنه
تنازل
عن
حلمه
فى
النهاية
لصالح
اخته
التى
كانت
تريد
أن
تهرب
معه
...
رضى
بما
هو
واقع
...
و
انخرط
فى
عداد
حضارة
الأرقام
كلنا
مجرد
رقم
فى
بطاقة
فى
ملف
فى
أجهزة
حكومية
عتيقة
تتحكم
بمصائرنا

the

whatev

of

of
the

the
idea

revisit

but
i

been
afraid
what
if
holden
did

stand
up
to
the
pedest

occupi
in

what
if
j.d.
saling
is
n't
as

of

when

i

to
justifi
that
posit
on
my
favorit

took
me
a
week

half
to

thi

becaus
i
want
to
savor
it
what
a

stori
teller
if

'd
learn
how
to
break
a
few
paragraph
everi
onc
in

holden
you
get
holden
that
moment
when
he
held
the
snowbal
and
look
out
over
the
snowi
street
below
unabl
to
throw
the
snowbal
becaus
it
look
too
pretti
wa
such
a
fabul
exampl
of
show
us
holden
's
person
and
hi
insecur
about
himself
in
the
world
that
it
made
me
smile
so
much
of
hi
quirki
person
word
choic
exagger
and
the
way
j.d.
saling
write
it
with
such
power
and
metaphor
made
me
smile
well
minu
the
use
of
about
the
onli

make
me
cring
i
have
a
weak
for
good
boy
protagonist
girl
get
whini
and
annoy
but
boy
bottl
it
up
so
you
want
to
protect
them
i
found
the
scene
where
holden
fight
with
hi
roommat
for
say
he
mess
around
with
a
girl
he
like
so
power
you
can
feel
the
emot
breath
off
holden
and
know
exactli
what
he
's
think
despit
what
he
say
for
all
hi
angst
saling
give
us
enough
of
hi
emot
breakdown
and
hi
show
of
good
heart
that
you
feel
for
him
even
if
you
want
to
shake
him
deal
with
hi

you

cautionari

saling

that

should

it
