legal
of

“

is
written
from
humbert
’s
point
of
view.it
is
not
just
a
recollect
in
hi
mind
it
is
a
formal
written
document.h
sat
down
and
wrote
it
in
56
day
between
hi

with
the
crime
of
murder
clare
quilti
and
hi
death
in

befor
hi
trial
could
occur.for
me
the
written
document
is
a
fascin
choic
of
literari
devic
to
tell
the
story.th
document
becom
a
book
within
a
book.whil
nabokov
obvious
wrote
it
all
that
he
purport
to
do
is
sandwich
it
between
a
foreword
and
a
much
later
afterword.thi
devic
set
up
an
interest
relationship
between
humbert
and
the
reader.for
humbert
it
is
akin
to
a
confess
or
a
wit
statement.to
thi
extent
what
he
confess
to
is
clearli
enough
to
convict
him
of
the
crime
of
murder.howev
in
it
he
also
set
out
detail
of

that
for

reason

the

in
that
it
wa
a

that

take

we
all
make

about

can
we
account

our
choices?ther
’s
no
account
for

at
the
heart
of
thi
aesthet
approach
to
love
is
a
fear

disgust
at

is

also

becaus
i
love
the
perfect

my

i
have

therefor
have
to

wonder
whether
it
is
onli
possibl
to
have
thi
view
if
you
have
never
had
your

biolog
child.parenthood
is
an

is
an
illus
to
believ
that
you
can
live
and
defeat
it.but
tell
that
to
the
cosmet
industry.so
far
i
have
talk
of
love
in
the
abstract.in
the
first
part
of
the
book
i
struggl
to
understand
humbert
’s
love
and
the
abov
is
what
i
came
up
with.i
wo
n’t
say
i
had
a
sympathi
for
him
but
i
think
i
understood
him
and
hi
love.i
even
understood
hi
obsessiveness.how
mani
of
us
dure
the
first
throe
of
love
trap
and
oppress
our
love
object
so
much
so
that
we
are
not
abl
to
see
how
oppress
we
were
until
after
the
relationship
ha
been
consumm
or
morph
into
someth
more
matur
or
ended?howev
thing
start
to
chang
at
the
end
of
the
first
part
the
consumm
and
into
the
second
part
the
imprison
of
cours
the
love
had
to
be
consumm
but
as
unexcept
as
the
descript
of
the
event
wa
it
highlight
the
realiti
that
the
first
part
wa
a
trap
for
lolita
to
walk
into.a
play
and
lyric
as
the
languag
might
have
been
it
wa
sinist
in
intent.second
part
captiv

dure
the
second
part
have
captur
lo
humbert
make
it
clear
that
hi
love
will
last
no
more
than
three
year
to
be
precis
1
januari
1947
to
1
januari
1950
which
are
effect
her
12th
to
15th
birthdays.aft
thi
statist
at
least
lo
will
morph
out
of
her
nymphet
form.so
humbert
's
love
is
sole
for
a
definit
phase
of
her
entir
life
after
which
he
expect
and
intend
to
abandon
her.dur
thi
phase
humbert
’s
goal
is
to
maintain
lolita
in
captiv
to
ensur
her
avail
for
him
alon
there
is
no
fairi
tale
promis
of
“
happili
ever

”
or
“’
til

do
us
part
”
in
thi
love
action.ther
is
no
love
or
concern
for
the
other
onli
selfish
and
narcissism.i
have
tri
to
view
the
definit
of
beauti
that
appeal
to
humbert
as
an
aesthet
issue.i
have
tri
to
divorc
it
from
moral
so
i
can
understand
it
better.howev
whether
i
think
of
it
in
term
of
aesthet
or
moral
obsess
or
love
the
fact
that
it
could
be
switch
on
and
off
at
such
identifi
time
turn
me
against
humbert.h
is
in
control
of
thi
feel
call
love
at
least
he
know
with
clinic
precis
when
he
will
return
to
“
normal
”
or
a
state
of
not
loving.hi
love
wa
a
drug
that
he
took
too
knowingli
he
knew
precis
when
the
feel
of
the
drug
would
wear
off.so
i
start
to
believ
that
there
wa
no
loss
of
self
in
hi
love.instead
it
wa
a
heighten
or
gross
act
of
narcissism.bi
extens
there
wa
no
sens
in
which
he
tri
to
satisfi
lo
person
or
sexually.ther
wa
no
sens
of
a
mutual
satisfi
relationship
or
intercours
although
to
be
fair
he
doe
n't
go
into
the
sexual
detail
except
in
term
of
physic
exert
howev
i
got
the
sens
that
when
it
came
to
consumm
hi
love
it
wa
just
about
stick
hi
dick
into
hi
love
object.ok
lot
of
sexual
relationship
can
be
reduc
to
thi
fundament
penetr
act.som
men
see
femal
as
no
more
than
a
receptacl
for
male
and
it
fluid
manifest
the
cup
into
which
they
spill
their
seed.howev
i
start
to
feel
in
the
second
part
that
humbert
's
aim
wa
to
defil
or
despoil
the
beauti
that
had
appeal
to
him
in
the
first
part
even
if
it
wa
transgress
and
the
three
year
zone
of
enchant
highlight
to
me
that
humbert
would
just
go
in
search
of
the
next
beauti
nymphet
to
stick
hi
dick
into.so
it
becam
increasingli
appar
to
me
that
he
wa
a
serial
despoil
of
beauti
not
a
genuin
lover
or
admir
of
beauty.ther
is
a
hatr
or
disgust
hotwir
into
thi
love.y
do
n't
normal
hate
the
flower
in
your
vase
when
it
come
time
to
remov
them
and
throw
them
in
the
dustbin.but
you
get
the
sens
that
humbert
would
have
been
disgust
by
hi
former
love
object
hi
objet
d'obsess
the
moment
that
calendar
click
over.obvi
thi
same
disgust
or
loss
of
interest
appear
in
more
tradit
relationships.it
could
lie
behind
the
mid-lif
crisi
when
the
guy
run
away
with
the
younger
woman.it
could
explain
the
inabl
to
accept
the
inevit
of
age
at

in

could
explain
we
male
who
still
pictur

as
the
immut
20
year
old
who
deserv
a
young
and
nubil
partner
no
matter
how
soft
or
old
or

or

i
wrote
most
of
my
comment
about
the
second
part
befor
i
had
finish
read
the
last
part
of
the
novel.i
have
to
emphasis
that
most
of
what
turn
me
against
humbert
came
from
my
reaction
to
hi
own
words.neith
he
nor
nabokov
held
back
the
materi
that
would
make
me
hate
him.stil
i
read
on

in
their
constrict

until
chapter
29
when
humbert
and
the
seventeen
year
old
marri
and

dolor
meet
again.what
you
think
of
humbert
and
hi

thi
is

realiz

at

my

actual
romanticis
humbert
's
deprav
and
saw
the

between
him
and
lolita
as
some
tragic
love
affair
that
could
never
work
out
for
the
obviou
reason
it
wa
surpris
surpris
tatiana
's
review
that
made
me
wonder
if
i
'd
had
a
screw
loos
when
read
thi
year
ago
her
interpret
wa
so
far
from
what
i
rememb
that
i
simpli
had
to
find
time
for
a
re-read
thi
summer
i
did
just
that
i
am
go
to
point
my
shame
finger
of
blame
at
my
age
when
i
first
read
it
i
wa
as
fool
by
humbert
as
the
young
lolita
was.humbert
is
not
a
reliabl
narrat
hi
declar
that
lolita
wa
respons
for
seduc
him
is
repuls
and
wrong
becaus
in
the
end
an
adult
ha
no
excus
for
have
sex
with
a
child
even
if
they
're
walk
around
half-nak
and
offer
it
up
adult
have
a
respons
not
to
take
advantag
of
children
and
i
now
realiz
how
thi
case
is
no
except
thi
is
not
some
tragic
romant
tale
about
forbidden
love
it
is
the
stori
of
how
a
grown
man
repeatedli
rape
a
young
girl
the
fact
that
it
is
so
easi
to
be
taken
in
by
him
either
say
someth
about
how
brilliant
a
writer
nabokov
is
which
he
is
or
how
much
societi
still
love
to
blame
the
victim.i
do
n't
know
whether
to
feel
better
about
my
origin
feel
or
be
horrifi
that
even
the
descript
for
the
audiobook
describ
the
novel
as
a
love
stori
almost
shock
in
it
beauti
and
tender
and
i
also
know
that
i
have
no
right
to
criticis
other
peopl
who
saw
it
in
such
a
way
but
i
would
ask
you
to
read
it
again
to
look
beyond
humbert
's
snivel
and
self-piti
to
see
the
man
who
consid
murder
a
woman
so
he
can
be
free
to
have
sex
with
her
twelv
year
old
daughter
the
man
who
feel
sorri
for
himself
when
a
pubesc
girl
doe
n't
want
to
have
sex
with
him
becaus
she
's
still
hurt
from
the
last
time
is
that
love
mayb
it
wa
for
a
thirteen
year
old
look
through
humbert
's
pervert
eye
but
i
'm
glad
i
understand
it
better
now.nabokov
ha
written
a
brilliant
and
disturb
novel
my
opinion
of
it
ha
n't
chang
in
that
respect
i
found
it
surprisingli
easi
to
read
and
becam
absorb
quickli
even
all
those
year
ago
hi
portray
of
humbert
's
pervert
mind
is
scarili
good
perhap
even
too
good
if
peopl
can
so
easili
be
convinc
to
side
with
a
paedophil
which
is
often
regard
as
the
ultim
crime
of
all
is
n't
it
even
cold-blood
murder
go
after
prison
who
've
mess
with
kid
and
as
much
as
i
feel
asham
for
be
so
taken
in
by
humbert
i
know
that
it
's
not
just
me
who
wa
fool
hell
even
the
gr
descript
prove
it
but
believ
me
lolita
is
a
victim
and
no
amount
of
sadden

if

to

thi
would
be

ten.but
what
if
as

that
thi

to
my

becom
three
dimension
at
odd
moment
here
and
there
he
come
off
as
a
minc
foppish
but
ultim
unbeliev
sort
i
never
bought
into
him
until
veri
near
the
end
when
for
a
few
sentenc
nabokov
make
hi
remors
credibl
but
it
is
too
late
for
that
i
wa
alreadi
annoy
as
hell
by
hi
rococo
narrat
the
charact
of
lolita
as
well
is
shrill
and
one
note
through
out
onli
intermitt
doe
she
come
across
as
worthi
of
compass
as
for
the
stori
onc
the
seduct
take
place
it
lose
a
lot
of
it
forward
momentum
it
begin
to
feel
repetit
and
onli
come
aliv
again
when
humbert
reach
the
veri
end
of
hi
self
control
and
attempt
to
lash
out
at
one
he
believ
wrong
him
all
in
all
i
think
thi
is
a
book
that
could
stand
to
lose
about
fifti
page
there
is
much
to
love
about
it
though
it
could
have
been
truli
replus
nabokov
knew
that
hi

that

to

older
men
he
also
think
hi
pedophilia
might
be
the
result
of
hi
desir
to
regain
someth
of
a
romanc
he
had
when
he
wa
a
teenag
wherein
the
girl
he
wa
in
love
with
die
i
sympath
with
him
here
and
we
were
move
into
moral
gray
territori
so
i
thought
the
book
wa
on
track
to
be
everyth
everyon
say
it
is
if
he
and
a
young
girl
fell
in
love
with
each
other
i
would
certainli
question
a
lot
of
thing
i
thought
before.nop
noth
between
him
and
lolita
can
be
describ
as
love
let
see
he
detest
lolita
's
person
he
want
to
impregn
lolita
so
he
could
molest
her
children
and
their
grandchildren
when
she
wa
too
old
for
him
to
find
attract
he
would
rape
her
despit
the
fact
that
she
cri
everi
time
he
would
rape
her
when
she
wa
serious
ill
he
mind-fuck
her
thoroughli
he
physic
abus
her
he
manipul
her
into
sex
act
by
pay
her
money
and
other
thing
she
want
effect
turn
her
into
a
prostitute.needless
to
say
i
felt
no
moral
ambigu
when
the
novel
end
he
wa
just
a
crazi
pervert
that
doe
n't
make
me
rethink
what
love
is
at
all
sinc
love
enter
nowher
in
the
equat
--
it
wa
the
lust
of
a
psycholog
unstabl
man
i
wa
n't
disquiet
by
ani
sort
of
sympathi
for
him
past
the
first
coupl
chapter
it
becom
clear
that
he
's
just
a
horribl
person
who
tri
to
justifi
hi
pedophilia
with
thing
that
do
n't
sound
so
bad.in
fact
the
novel
just
reaffirm
what
i
thought
befor
that
pedophil
are
bad
peopl
who
ruin
children
's
live
and
on
the
whole
it
seem
complet
pointless.what
's
wors
is
that
it
's
a
fairli
slow
read
with
fifti
page
pass
at
a
time
with
noth
happen
nabokov
's
prose
is
impress
and
clever
but
about
two-third
of
the
write
serv
no
purpos
so
much
of
that
same
prose
actual
dilut
and
detract
from
the
book
i
would
say
to
myself
that
's
an
amaz
descript
of
someth
complet
pointless
he
seem
to
just
like
to
hear
himself
talk
at
point
and
hi
afterward
seem
to
confirm
thi
i
feel
like
the
book
would
have
been
better
off
if
those
passag
had
been
omitted.howev
i
can
appreci
the
realism
of
humbert
humbert
's
charact
in
fact
the
one
thing
the
stori
had
go
for
it
wa
realism
it
just
felt
pointless
by
the
time
i
finish
when
i
wa
expect
someth
much
more
groundbreak
it
might
be
fair
to
blame
all
the
peopl
who
over-hyp
the
book
rather
than
blame
nabokov
remov
from
the
hype
it
merit
are
easier
to
see
the
more
i
think
about
it
perhap
mani
other
have
misinterpret
the
book
it
seem
to
me
that
nabokov
's
purpos
wa
to
punish
the
narrat
i
can
see
the
appeal
of
that
though
i
still
feel
it
wa
pointless
and
it
's
certainli
less
lofti
than
some
of
the
thing
the
other
interpret
say
but
at
least
it
's
more
accur
to
be
honest
i
'm
a
littl
irrit
that
i
went
into
read
the
book
base
on
what
appear
to
be
a
complet
off-bas
interpret
becaus
i
ca
n't
quit
undo
that
in
my
mind
on
the
one
hand
it
seem
unfair
to
critic
an
author
on
the
basi
that
they
did
n't
chang
how
i
think
but
i
'm
not
sure
how
i
could
have
avoid
it
sinc
the
cover
of
my
edit
ha
a
quot
that
call
it
the
onli
convinc
love
stori
of
our
time
it
's
not
a
horribl
book
but
it
's
probabl
the
most

book
i

if

you
’ve
probabl

import

to

as

your

and
lp
befor
shove
them
in

destin
for

believ
me
your

when
you
take

consid
how
killer
it

a-ha
all

it
’s
possibl
you

thought

for
lolita
mayb
thi
tangenti
bullshit
will
help
get
my
point
across
…
i
’ve
recent
taken
a
keen
interest
in
watch
“
deadliest
catch
”
but
as
soon
as
the
show
conclud
i
wonder
“
what
have
i
walk
away
with
after
invest
50
minut
and
4
rum
coke
to
the
accompani
of
these
awe-inspir
imag
of
man
battl
the
element
to
strike
bepinc
gold
”
not
much
appear
to
be
the
answer
it
’s
just
a
bunch
of
crab
crab
crab
and
master-bait
the
simpl
ingredi
of
all
my
friendship
and
relationship
sure
it
’s
awesom
to
watch
sea-far
maniac
risk
life
and
limb
to
haul
in
the
nasti
creatur
that
pay
their
bill
but
there
’s
noth
els
to
it
just
dude
get
stoke
over
a
huge
haul
of
crab
or
lament
some
element
of
the
life
they
’ve
chosen
then
you
get
to
think
how
these
dude
’
wive
manag
without
them
at
sea
for
20
day
at
a
time
obvious
they
are
in
the
crab-catch
busi
as
well
and
the
real
kick
in
the
ass
is
that
i
do
n’t
even
eat
crab
hell
i
’ve
never
even
tri
a
dish
that
incorpor
ani
crab
when
i
consid
the
ridicul
of
it
all
it
seem
pretti
dishearten
thi
sort
of
pointless
introspect
is
probabl
how
de
esseint
got
hi
start
so
i
’ll
leav
it
at
that
befor
it
becom
habit-form
i
ca
n’t
say
that
my
opinion
of
lolita
is
much
differ
it
’s
just
humbert
humbert
endlessli
rhapsod
about
nymphett
most
substanti
hi
nymphett
lolita
and
that
’s
it
i
’ve
probabl
never
read
anyth
so
one-dimension
in
my
life
i
’m
sure
the
upper
echelon
of
literari
critic
found
myriad
reason
beyond
my
primit
sensibl
for
includ
thi
in
the
top
100
work
of

centuri
fiction
i
just
do
n’t
happen
to
see
it
one
of
these
qualifi

be
thi
absurd
statement
on

back
cover
‘

the

recent
be
all

you

that
in

somehow

a

written
by
a
writer
whose

i
could

and
alreadi
adjudg
the

as
dirti
and
never

...
ever
i
wa
not
alway
a
reader
and
never
encourag
to
be
one
till
the
age
of
19
and
even
when
i
becam
one
i
had
the
task
of
becom
a
broad-mind
reader
from
a
narrow-mind
one
and
i
am
sole
respons
for
thi
transit
big
deal
no
not
realli
it
’s
just
that
thi
arrang
made
me
appreci
variou
form
of
art
especi
movi
music
and
book
and
then
of
cours
lolita
becam
as
a
must-read
while
i
wa
explor
the
sea
of
word
around
the
world
the
brillianc
of
nabokov
would
have
been
establish
in
my
mind
had
i
read
ani
other
book
by
him
but
lolita
the
seductress
that
she
is
demand
to
be
read
befor
ani
of
those
book
and
read
it
is
what
i
did
thi
chef-d'oeuvr
is
glow
with
perfect
everi
word
of
thi
text
is
emit
a
light
of
such
splendor
that
for
it
be
readabl
by
someon
it
had
to
dim
a
littl
by
it
despic
theme
pedophilia
and
that
theme
could
be
the
sole
reason
whi
it
is
detest
by
mani
is
it
a
fair
reaction
of
cours
it
is
is
the
filth
contain
between
word
too
much
for
one
to
handl
may
be
did
nabokov
play
a
master
stroke
by
pull
off
one
hilari
passag
after
anoth
and
make
the
reader
laugh
hard
while
talk
about
humbert
's
viciou
intent
that
’s
whi
he
’s
great
right
these
are
some
question
i
ask
myself
on
the
surfac
but
there
were
mani
other
question
wait
to
be
answer
that
had
a
more
gener
role
with
respect
to
thi
book
wikipedia
describ
thi
book
as
a
tragicomedi
but
i
beg
to
differ
i
did
n’t
feel
ani
remors
or
sympathi
toward
humbert
at
the
end
view
spoiler
when
he
realiz
hi
love
for
dolor
hide
spoiler
and
how
he
wa
manipul
but
it
all
seem
‘
fair
enough
’
to
me
as
far
as
dolor
is
concern
her
charact
sketch
her
play
her
awar
about
her
impact
on
humbert
and
the
fate
she
face
at
the
end
wa
the
perfect
recip
to
be
consum
by
reader
to
produc
a
piti
belch
at
the
most
becaus
as
must
have
notic
by
mani
the
whole
damn
narrat
is
from
humbert
’s
point
of
view
and
poor
dolor
wa
more
or
less
left
at
the
merci
of
worthy/unworthi
reader
but
sinc
humbert
himself
confess
hi
intent
hi
dilemma
hi
happi
hi
sad
he
might
have
believ
himself
as
a
victim
of
a
tragedi
and
him
be
an
anti-hero
but
whatev
is
the
case
it
wa
not
easi
be
one
of
the
member
of
the
so-cal
juri
that
humbert
address
hi
reader
as
there
wa
a
constant
tug
of
war
between
variou
emot

are
some
exampl
“

is
the
wrong
word
the
elat
with
which
the

fill
me

in

nabokov
wa
sure
right
i
challeng
anyon
to
prove
beyond
ani
reason
doubt
that
lolita
ha
had
ani
effect
over
and
abov
the
one
he
name
and
in
principl
i
also
approv
of
nabokov
's
attitud
toward
critic
and
the
way
he
love
teas
them
pale
fire
is
anoth
long
joke
at
the
critic
expens
how
mani
other
book
are
there
where
most
of
the
action
take
place
in
the
footnot
and
like
john
shade
he
burn
hi
rough
draft
to
make
sure
that
poster
had
as
littl
materi
as
possibl
to
work
with
but
if
one
want
to
go
against
nabokov
's
state
wish
and
indulg
in
a
small
amount
of
specul
it
doe
seem
to
me
that
lolita
ha
had
a
substanti
effect
in
term
of
popular
the
narr
techniqu
where
a
charact
is
initi
present
in
sympathet

then
gradual
reveal
as

two
exampl
that
immedi

the
fact
remain
that
whatev
excus
you
may
come
up
with
it
's
just
wrong
for
an
adult
male
to
have
sex
with
a
twelv
year
old
girl
after

while
humbert
and
the
reader
is
forc

he
ha
turn
her
into
a
whore
who
fellat
him
for
small
chang
and
then
cri
herself

you

____________________________________
while
make
dinner
turkey
fajita
i
thought
about
the
question
paul
rais
whether
we
can
believ
what
humbert
is
tell
us
i
wa
wonder
what
evid
i
could
present
to
support
my
point
of
view
which
is
that
he
onli
distort
the
truth
and
omit
thing
rather
than
simpli
lie
outright.i
would
say
that
my
basic
argument
is
that
humbert
is
n't
realli
write
for
us
he
's
write
for
himself
so
ani
lie
he
tell
are
go
to
be
the
kind
of
lie
one
tell
to
oneself
rather
than
those
one
tell
to
other
peopl
it
's
true
that
peopl
do
sometim
plain
flat-out
lie
to
themselv
but
humbert
is
a
smart
educ
guy
who
think
a
lot
and
he
doe
n't
seem
delusion
i
find
it
plausibl
that
he
is
more
tell
the
stori
hi
way
and
work
hard
to
find
an
interpret
that
make
hi
action
pardon
but
thi
involv
greater
and
greater
distort
of
the
fact
and
in
the
end
there
are
thing
he
can
no
longer
explain
away
it
hit
so
hard
becaus
he
's
previous
done
a
good
job
of
make
the
reader
identifi
with
him
the
reader
almost
feel
that
he
ha
been
lie
to
himself.i
came
up
with
a
coupl
more
book
to
which
i
'd
had
similar
reaction
one
is
agatha
christi
's
the
murder
of
roger
ackroyd
where
it
turn
out
that
the
murder
is
the
person
narrat
the
stori
i
rememb
a

say
that
noth
had
ever
creep
him
out
quit
as
badli
he
felt
for
a
second
that
he
himself
wa
the
murder
less
obvious
there
's
sartr
's
l'âge

mathieu
doe
n't
seem
like
such
a
bad
guy
even
though
he
's
a
bit
of
a
dope
and
noth
he
doe
realli
come
across
as
particularli
evil
yet
somewher
near
the
end
you
're
forc
to
admit
that
he
is
in
fact
a
person
who
will
steal
a
substanti
amount
of
money
from
a
friend
in
order
to
pay
for
hi
mistress
's
abort
you
wonder
whi
you
previous
felt
sympathetic.a
final
thought
i
had
while
prepar
dinner
one
of
the
veri
scariest
thing
about
lolita
is
that
humbert
in
a
real
sens
love
lo
howev
thi
result
in
him
rape
her
and
turn
her
into
a
child
prostitut
a
coupl
of
year
ago
i
watch
the
movi
mysteri
skin
which
take
the
same
theme
even
further
it
's
one
of
the
most
disquiet
film
i
've
ever
seen
ha
anyon
els
come
across
it
would
be
interest
to
get
reaction

ha

onli
through

of
humbert
our
typic

so
the

ha

of
the
trajectori
of
a
pain
tragic
young
life
as
for

from

one
get
the
impress
that
nabokov
is
toy
with
the

when
he
introduc
us

creat
the
perfect
unreli

who
even
right
from

side

he
like

he
is
a

pedophil
who
can
bare
restrain
hi
lust
at
the
sight
of
9-12
year
old

so
definit
not
a

there
is
ampl
reason
to
distrust
him

to
watch

inconsist
in

humbert
tell

watch

see
how
what

say
tend
to
be
contradict
later
on
either
by
himself
or
by
what
the
other
charact
tell
us.nabokov
lay
it
on
so
thick
that
humbert
who
find
17
year

and
who
talk
about
a
fourteen-year
old
as
my

mistress
appear
almost

that
i
could
switch
in
the
cours
of
the

day
from

pole
of
insan
to
the

—
from
the
thought
that
around

have
to
get

of

must

know

then
come
the

in

i
had
been

by

out
there
is
when

doe
escap

then
in

final
confront
the
famou

as
utter
by

...
and
i
look
and
look
at
her
and
knew
as
clearli
as
i
know
i
am
to

that
i
love
her
more
than
anyth
i

she

the

but
thank

it
wa
not

i

upon

i
feel
that
nabokov
introduc
too
much
ambival
regard
the
fact
that
humbert
had
rape
lolita
the
aspect
that
i
have
a
problem
with
is
that
lolita
is
seen
to
alreadi
have
had
sexual
intercours
at
the
age
of
12
albeit
with
anoth
child
apologist
for
pedophilia
are
grab
at
thi
straw
as
if
it
make
ani
differ
to
what
humbert
did
the
fact
that
she
wa
not
a
virgin
is
no
excus
humbert
rape
her
and
ruin
her
life
and
there
is
no
vindic
for
thi
in
addit
i
feel
that
nabokov
did
not
suffici
show
the
intens
psycholog
damag
it
doe
to
a
young
person
of
thi
age
if
a

in

intens
feel
of
shame
low
self-esteem
and
self-hatr
along
with
long-term
rage
and
most
like
symptom
of
ptsd
are
usual
the
result
i
feel
that
although
nabokov
did
show
lolita
as
a
broken
person
in
the
end
and
although
her
life
did
not
extend
beyond
the
age
of
17
becaus
of
humbert
nabokov
did
not

allow

thi

about

desper
tri

ascrib
mean
beyond
the
mere

of
the
novel
to
read
into
the
dispar
between
natur
and
action
a
see-saw
of
poetri
and
debaucheri
i
also
wonder
how
much
i
miss
out
on
due
to
my
handicap
of
not
know
french.th
primari
effect
of
thi
beauti
and
poetri
is
that
we
keep
gete
charm
by
thi
old-world
aristocrat
protagonist
who
can
talk
in
such
a
poetic
way
and
then
he
gentli
turn
around
and
remind
us
of
what
he
is
contempl
do
to
that
young
girl
and
we
draw
back
in
revuls
again
onli
to
be
ensnar
in
hi
honey
prose
a
few
line
later
and
so
it
goe
tire
you
out
and
enchant
you.so
a
review
will
come
as
soon
as
i
can
reconcil
the
beauti
of
the
novel
with
it
deep
dark
underbelli
and
some
mean
that
is
not
mere
moral
emerg
that
might
take
mani
read
and
i
am
not
sure
that
is
someth
i
am
will
to
put
myself
through
but
a
review
howev
small
help
clarifi
the
book
in
my
head
and
for
that
i
will
try.anoth
thing
i
want
to
make
sens
of
is
thi
nabokov
’s
account
of
the
old
newspap
stori
that
inspir
him
to
start
a
work
such
as
lolita
present
in
the
novel
’s
afterword
"
on
a
book
entitl
lolita
"
the
stori
wa
about
“
an
ape
in
the
jardin
de
plant
who
after
month
of
coax
by
the
scientist
produc
the
first
draw
ever
charcoal
by

the

"
is
n't
that
just
surreal
the
connect
with
humbert
is
right
there
at
the
edg

my
imagin

own
prison
mayb
and
mayb
in
the
prison
that
wa
hi
life
's
lust
i
do
n't
now
but
what
pleasur
to
ponder.on
thing
i
can
confid
say
even
with
my
shock
at
the
rest
of
the
novel
is
that
the
open
paragraph
is
perhap
the
most
beauti
and
allur
one
i
have
ever
read
it
draw
you
into
thi
pervers
univers
where
everi
dark
secret
thought
is
open
to
scrutini
like
some
succubi
a
beauti
mermaid
or
lamia
who
lure
you
onli
to
crucifi
you
the
mind
thrill
and
the
eye
laze
over
the
paragraph
and
you
are
aglow
in
the
ecstasi
the
rest
of
the
book
seem
to
promis
think
of
the
beauti
that
is
wait
for
you
in
those
page
the
play
of
languag
the
thrill
of
appreci
such
wonder
and
you
are
happi
that
thi
book
lolita
that
you
have
heard
so
much
about
is
go
to
be
a
delight
but
of
cours
the
book
is
just
like
a
nymph
as
describ
in
it
it
tantal
with
ether
beauti
onli
to
expos
our
world
to
the
harsh
realiti
of
man
's
natur
at
least
i
think
so
the
book
is
the
real

thi

wa
still
abl
to
be
a

accomplish
in
write
it
made
me
ponder
on
a
seri
of
question
and
it
kept
my
interest
for
it
go
even
on
the
occas
i
had
to
put
the

becaus
it

be
insid
of
such
a

and
disgust
mind
as
humbert
humbert
’s
but
i
have
to
confess
that
i
found
the
narr
so
intrigu
even
know

wa
quit
possibl
unreli
that
at
some
point
i
found
myself
be
less

less
protect
of
lo
i
wa
feel
annoy
by
lolita
all
the
time

her
spoil
dirti
littl

behavior
crazi
i
know
i
’ll
say
it
onc
more
thi
is
a
great
book
take
my
time
to
delv
more
into
her
person
though
i
realiz
that
she
wa
simpli
a
product
of
her
relationship
with
her
mother
her
father
wa
gone
and
charlott
treat
her
unfairli
and
creat
such
a
competit
and
unfair
environ
for
a
child
and
then
enter
an
older
allow
sympathet
man
more
like
sympathet
charact
as
that
wa
hi
act
who
's
not
tell
her
what
to
do
and
how
to
behav
the
complet
opposit
of
her
mother
i
figur
that
mayb
in
her
emot
incap
mind
she
wa
simpli
move
from
an
abus
relationship
to
anoth
and
that
’s
whi
she
felt
compel
to
him
in
the
beginning.a
difficult
aspect
of
the
stori
to
deal
with
for
me
wa
that
lolita
seem
to
want
to
be
with
humbert
and
i
start
wonder
if
thi
could
be
call
a
love
stori
of
cours
she
did
n’t
have
ani
discern
which
twelv
year
old
girl
doe
and
wa
not
in
ani
way
matur
enough
prepar
and
emot
and
physic
capabl
of
make
thi
decis
and
he
did
n’t
leav
her
much
of
a
choic
but
still
at
some
point
it
seem
we
were
watch
the
downfal
of
your
normal
everi
day
relationship
between
two
consent
grown-up
and
mind
you
that
even
grown-up
have
childish
behavior
special
when
in
a
broken
relationship
later
on
i
realiz
it
wa
n’t
that
she
want
to
be
with
him
it
wa
that
she
did
n’t
know
ani
better
she
did
n’t
know
she
could
get
out
and
did
n’t
know
what
els
wa
out

lolita
got

she

which
seem

in

at

she
end
up
marri
a

humbl

she
